i just love being drenched in sweat when i get to work, because of no ac in my vehicle #showeringwaspointless 
it depends what the car is doing. if in turning right for example, i don't expect a cyclist to come round me on the right hand side. this has happened more than once, and with motorcycles.

one of my biggest pet peeve is when someone chews loud enough for me to hear it... arghhh #chewsilently

my moms bf is so stupid. sometimes i just want to slap some sense into him 
. @ googlemybiz i have been struggling with a suspended business listing for about a month now with no help. everything on my listing is authentic. how do you expect people to fix some issue without even telling the issue. 
if small business owners,especially new ones, want to succeed i suggest they don't spend all day on their phones,learn their stock,greet every customer as if they were actually important,don't stand smoking right outside the door etc. #smallbusiness

agreeing with @ eamonnholmes the whispering is @ thismorning 
it takes me over an hour by train to get friday morning meetings. it’s so busy i always am shushed and have to stand the whole way. #missthequitelife
