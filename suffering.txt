when a person accepts jesus christ as their savior they're automatically thrust into the midst of a battle. its a battle that's been ongoing since man was in the garden of eden. god will give them a little time to learn some things first. #truth #word #spiritualwarfare 
when you remind the lord of his word, he will dispatch angels to bring it to pass. this is a form of #spiritualwarfare. don't forget to put on your armor daily, you are a warrior too. ephesians 6 #truth #word 
in the instance #weapons are directed toward you, god has promised they will come of no effect. they maybe formed, but they won't prosper. you can remind him of this in prayer. the angels hearken to the word. psalm 103:20 isaiah 54:17 #truth #word 
sometimes its not for disobedience you're going through but counter attack / #weapons directed at you. you are doing something to push against the kingdom of darkness & have made the adversary mad. isaiah 54:17 #truth #word 
if god allows the adversary to buffer you its because it will work toward your good, or favor in the end. see romans 8:28 and end result of job. #truth #word 
jobs' friends were saying he was because he was disobedient, but he was suffering for righteous sake, and the adversary had to get #permission to attack him from god. he always has to get permission first. #truth #word job chapt 1 
whatever is/ was done, its being recorded in books for the time of their judgment. revelation 20:12 #truth #word 
when evil people do bad things to you, its called for righteousness, and god will get the glory, because he will intervene, and set it right when you ask him. it also serves the purpose of drawing you closer to god forcing you to pray. #truth #word 1 peter 3:14 
another reason people suffer is disobedience to god and #discipline. deuteronomy 28:15-68 #truth #word 
when you're called to be a light (example) to someone you don't do things their way; you show a better/ higher way through your actions. #truth #word
