how to get your #customers to change a bad review 
@ uber 
@ hyundaicarsirl if this is a mechanical design issue i would like this repair covered in the parts guarantee. after this was the unique selling point when i purchased the vechicle. 
@ hyundaicarsirl so much so when sitting in traffic and changing gears often i can feel a lumber pain in my lower back. a quick look online this problem seems to be ubiquitos with the i40 so much so that hyundai have a modification in place, why was i not told this at h&m 
@ hyundaicarsirl when i queried the parts warranty i was told no garage in ireland will cover this. when collecting my car and speaking to staff they said it could last another 6 months. when driving my car home the clutch peddle is now stiffer!!!! than when it went in 
@ hyundaicarsirl i put it for a service with h&m yesterday 120k. when checking it in i asked for the tension in the clutch to be adjusted. i was told no its probably a pressure pad/plate and would more than likely be a new clutch. 
@ hyundaicarsirl hi my name is paraic cannon i purchased a 2nd hand 151 d i40 1 year ago with 100k km. it has a full up to date service history with hutton and meade. it always had a stiff clutch and i thought i cud get it loosened at next service due date. 
@ bombaytrooper this experience isn't good at all they don't bother to respond back. #onlineshopping #worseexperience

so, i basically escalate this for 2 issues: 1. amazon portal didnt get updated with product delivered & hence, induced this delay of 5 days (and counting...). 2. no action was taken after my first call to amazon customer care on 4th april 2018 #bad 
absolutely unimpressed with @ virginmedia at the moment...my network signal is absolutely terrible for a second day running. even using the new sim virgin said i needed after supposedly rolling out updates/changes. sort it out, virgin! #veryunimpressed 
@ kaigalway #justwow #never left always #reccomend 
are @ crosscountryuk able to run a train on time?? every day this 20.36 train is delayed until 20.55!! might aswell change the timetable!

disgusting service from @ boohoo and @ hermesparcels order next day delivery. driver doesn't even attempt to deliver. i waited in all day &no items recieved. i was told i would be on priority & recieve my items by 10am this morning.. still nothing.. #ruinedmybirthday

so disappointed that @ abcnetwork is only having #dwts on for 4 weeks. what a rip off to fans, the athletes, the pros, etc. we didn’t get to know the athletes like we normally would with a 10 week schedule. next week is the 1 hour finale and that is unacceptable!! 
@ alamo really frustrated with your service at boston logan. this is a first time with you guys and it is been a terrible experience. got a worn car with vomit no really cleaned. office didn't gave me much option. either pay more or get this one, after a intl flight.

@ bradfordmdc why is it when you phone to make a complaint, you're always caller 10-13? no matter what time you phone the que is the same!!! bradford council what does that tell you? is it that everyone is complaining?

@ karrimor_cs have to say im disappointed after opting for your brand over @ skechers_uk for the first time in a couple of years bought these tempo 5 tr shoes at a @ sportsdirect_cs store less than a week ago and have worn them for only 2 days and the sole has split away!

@ networkrail i travel from greenhithe to london mon/fri. i need to be there by 0630. this new "time table" has taken away 3 trains that would work and replaced it with thameslink. 
@ ring it makes no sense that if i switch my unit to an email that is on my account that you just decide that the subscription that i paid for is no longer valid and delete my stuff. 
what a dire shit show at @ showmasters collectormania @ thenec avoid like the plague. staff totally ruined a day out actually unhappy is not the word. tried to complain and i was turned away and told "you're not going to win and get a refund" 
@ asdaserviceteam what the point doing dine for 2 offer if you don’t have the goods could of substitute it for something else

@ peterengland_ exoecxting a quick revert, this is a major concern, i bought your apparels and now your shop is sealed, refund money or provide my trousers! treat this urgent.. invoice copy attached #quickrevertexpected #dissapointed 
~ifom, people cannot stop trying to get mi in the background of their photos without mi permission and with my explicit bodylanguage saying “no”. #unhappy. 
@ wendys i was positive we order a frosty...not a milk shake and when did customer service become so bad. smiles, happy faces, and being nice makes me want to come back. definitely lacked that here. 
@ tim_cook @ applesupport 3 years support for the 1st generation apple watch is a joke. my fake rolex from thailand has lasted longer... loyalty doesn’t pay #apple #applewatch #appleevent 
dear @ icicibank , today i got an opportunity to feel & understand the service of @ icicibank , but got surprised after hearing that it will take 30 days to resolve my dispute transaction and that too its not sure they said. #noservice #unsatisfied #no_service_at_fingertip 
@ flintshirecc i have video evidence of refuse collectors simply throwing away food caddys. now i have to cope without one and go out of my way to pick one up #recycling #counciltax #evidence

i'm in shock with the staff in my local @ starbucks!! disgusting #unclean 
#happy people are all #alike; every person is unhappy in it's own way. 
@ aircanada what gives? a 7 hour delay to change a tire? my 6:30 flight to montreal is now scheduled for 1:30. i got here at 4:30 am for my flight and now have missed a day of meetings. no one’s been very helpful or communicative. i used to love flying ac. no more.

@ southwestair how can people save seats when your boarding process goes by numbers...defeats the purpose and unfair. will eventually cause a issue with passengers 
how to treat #customers on #socialmedia? 
@ jennair our fridge we ordered in december was supposed to ship today. order didn’t make it on the truck and now non confirmed delivery date. any suggestions on how to fix since we wont have a fridge now? what happened? #nofridge #pleasehelp #needarealperson 
yes. there were 4 empty seats at the front that i could sit in for take off and landing. but i could use my belt the whole flight and it is all other my clothing. the reason i couldn't stay at the front was because you had to pay extra... 
disappointed- because i am not in a green zone, i can't get a tote? i live in texas, i need a tote. its 100 degrees. 
not all coincidences are happy! @ andrewoaten 
the one thing i miss about britain first on facebook is that my downtime hobby of laughing at how stupid and terrible people can be is no longer in one place. i know how to spend more time trying to find various accounts on twitter #shame #hobby 
@ directvnow can you people please fix whatever issues you're having!? every channel, every day, every 5+ mins this happens. yes, i have trouble shooter, restarted the router, and uninstalled the app. this is terrible and i'm tired of paying for shit i can't even watch!

angry, b&m apparently got another shipment of twinkies yesterday, but the shelves were empty. same again today. @ hostess_snacks should open a shop in edinburgh, scotland. it would solve everything #twinkieloveforever #twinkiewithdrawlsymptoms 
the #suicide of #katespade is more proof that how ever an amazing life it appears someone has they can still be very and very #lonely. we cant just assume that because someone appears to have ‘everything’ they are happy or even worse we shouldn’t expect them to be happy! 
thats an absolute shame! this is the reason i pay for unlimited.poole have done more screens before for unlimited. 
@ friedrich_ac @ friedrichair have the worst service process. they've already conceded the bad unit is within warrantee and therefore replaceable, but won't do so without a servicereport, which no technician wants to do because it's not worth their time :-( #badservice 
@ xiaomiindia @ manukumarjain what are you guys thinking? been a fan of mi so have redmi note 5 & 5pro and both don't have an oreo update yet. the lower brands being ur competition are committing of updating android p. and rn5pro is struggling on 7.1 version as on date. 
i woke up like this 
@ amazon @ amazonhelp just a heads up. might not be renewing my amazon prime this year. been with you for years now. service has declined, you raised the rates, prime shipping taking longer than a week to get. i know i am not the only one. hope something resolves. 
@ virginatlantic shame that you couldn’t supply me my nut free, vegetarian meal on board to mexico yesterday. even when requested... absolute shambles. 
even at happy hour people are talking about #gdpr #happyhour 
apparently the supplier says the product is not coming hence the email but the fetch website still says 'confirmed delivery: fri, 8 jun 2018' and nobody can really explain why. how do i make a complaint? i don't pay for a smartpass to get service and comms this poor. 
it's a little worrying when @ uhaul #selfstorage can't find the stuff they're supposed to have been looking after for the last five years! #customerexperience 
@ hamptonbyhilton i recently had a bad experience at your los angeles/hollywood location. it's been five days since i alerted the staff, and the hotel manager still has not contacted me. guest satisfaction is not important? @ hiltonhotels @ hiltonnewsroom @ hiltonhonors 
@ revolutapp who can i contact to discuss a complaint. #customerservice

@ askpapajohns i am very disappointed that after emailing you regarding my complaints over a week ago as you requested, i have had no response!! #badcustomerservice #papajohns 
your dm messages directed me back to uber support where it keeps going around in circles #customersupportfail 
@ asr can you please tell me when you will pay me out? it's been 3 months since we requested and you're still taking money from me. #badcustomerservice #tenyears 
@ creditonebank ugh! every month same issue... even with the correct acct number, still takes forever for payment to post 
@ directvnowhelp ...we haven’t been able to watch 5 minutes of tv at a time for days since the new app came out. not sure we can continue this relationship.

@ united flight 99 today had such an awful female staff! they constantly kept bumping their carts into me and kept forgetting to ask me for food and drinks! on a 16 hour flight! the only helpful crew member was the gentleman with the long locks! #badservice

@ dominos_uk ordered pizzas to work, the meat free pizza has chicken on. called the store and they couldn't have cares less. no apology, offered a new pizza but this wouldn't arrive for 90 minutes. #shitecustomerservice 
of course i have gestational diabetes. obviously. f***ing sh*t. #pregnancyproblems #leavemealone 
@ united love how you don’t respond to unhappy customers. 
not really as a tech has already come out days ago and won't be back for a week to fix what shouldn't have been an issue from the get go. unless you got credits i'm not sure i'll even still be a customer by the time they get here to fix it. #fedup

why is there no way of instantly telling why you're #unhappy? i know part of it is losing my beautiful baby girl kitty, sarah, but there is something else. they need an app for that #sigh. 
@ cwoa arrived at the safari hotel - experienced rude staff and “enjoy the giraffe themed decor and watch the real giraffe roaming the wanyama reserve right outside your window!” is inaccurate as the enclosure we overlook does not house the giraffes #dissaponted

last year, you bought #nycc tix then assigned them. this year you must assign them as part of the purchase process, so if there's any problem w/your fan verification the entire order is held up. also, why the eff cant you edit your cart? you have to cancel and restart. 
just enquired about a multi-car insurance policy with @ hastingsdirect to learn the multi-car team doesn't work at weekends. better to have been told that 45mins ago when i selected multi-car from the telephone menu? it’s something they’re "working to fix”, apparently.

relationships require communication to function well. if you're unhappy in a relationship, then discuss the issues making you #unhappy. staying silent because you don’t want conflict or you don’t believe things will change is simply not acceptable. #relationshiptip
