notre dame took a step forward this season, and today they took 2 steps back. this one is on swarbrick. pay the assistants what they're worth. he doesn't give a damn about winning, and turned an elite program into a stepping stone job.

if you have it in you to brutally murder an innocent 2 year old baby boy then you have absolutely no good in you. the fact people like that were even considered to be freed and given anonymity is a failure of the system. no way to rehabilitate evil

the very nasty party just became the very very very nasty party. ! 
that 2005 lmp/pp interview is the last thing that had anything to do with oprah that i've watched since. 
@ hm your apology is not accepted. all that you said you would do should have been done a priori. 
truly the #liarinchief @ realdonaldtrump is just a lying liar. it's irreprehensible! i'm just a american taxpayer. … 
because (after reading your tweets) you are a naive and arrogant man baby. and a racist. you think you’re so tolerant yet your tweets scream intolerance. typical liberalism. i doubt you know one conservative, one illegal or one black person. 
um...he didn’t rocket. he was placed by his father in law. he is not a political genius who rocketed to the top of american politics. seriously. why do you people even call yourselves journalists if this is the swill you are putting out? …

he should loose everything! … 
no excuses for the republicans to drag their feet except for their constant greed especially to pay for the #goptaxscam! 
@ walmart apparently, one of your stores lost my 50-year old slides that i entrusted to your store for transfer to digital. i was on hold with the photo lab and they decided to go home. 
remind me who the very fine people are again, please. 
#impeachtrump #impeach45 … 
tired of people excusing vulgarity, pettiness, threats, gaffes with 'oh, it's just trump being trump'. #potus needs to be a moral standard bearer. not the exception to the rule.

what if someone came at you with a pair of scissors and tried to cut off your clothing? how would you feel? she’s 11 years old! absolutely disgusted with this behaviour. #notmycanada … 
no decent man would speak like this. 
they should be talking about the rat fink that ratted him out. no trust, no loyalty, no respect for our president! 
what!!!!!! for a charity that’s outrageous given the desperate need of british veterans. no wonder they deleted that tweet! 
are you real? do people like you actually exist? 
how scary, that a hospital that should be caring for this woman would put her on the streets in her hospital gown in bellow freezing temperatures. …

how much more trash will we endure before the @ realdonaldtrump’s base is finally and #fed up? our wonderful country is becoming a worldwide laughing stock. #sad … 
sadly, our society's been aware of the complexities of patient dumping for decades. we need to work to fix our #healthcare system instead of trying to gut the aca, which was an admirable first step towards addressing these failures. #baltimorehospital … 
utterly ridiculous the unnecessary panic that was caused to everyone in hawaii and their families and friends all around the world. …

unfortunately she's not her mother or father, none of them are. while i'm in no way in disagreement here-it's a low bar indeed. the room in the wh was filled with smug looking faces/commenting on camera happily accepting the job to shield #45's dumbass. #disgusted! 
appalling customer service from @ thetrainline, who promised a refund, over the phone on an unused ticket - but are now refusing to pay. #swappingtovirgin 
everyday you prove over and over again why you are so unqualified to be president. you’ve turned what should be the most respected and coveted job on the planet into a ‘shithole’ presidency. 
@ sentoddyoung @ sendonnelly hoosiers are disgusted by your silence on the bigoted, irresponsible comments of @ realdonaldtrump. hoosiers want senators who stand behind all their constituents. …

totally agree! there is no place in our society for that kind of reference. much less coming from potus

@ chuckschumer @ nancypelosi guarantee, if you keep foolishly attacking @ potus & attempt to impeach him, no matter who the next democrat potus, there will be a loud call to impeach him or her. disliking potus isnt impeachable but u will set standard. w/dems.

again shocking but not surprising 
it's a shame that not one of @ thedemocrats voted for tax cuts for the american people. @ nancypelosi & @ senschumer just want more of our money for their ill-conceived policies & bigger gov't. they are the 1% & care more about #illegalaliens than the american people.

they are an embarrassment to all of us who in the 1970s marched on cap hill for era. no one woman i know would be so crass and vulgar. it was business to get done not who could be more shocking. as a small business owner, former women’s rights activist, mom, gmom

@ realdonaldtrump this shutdown is something i’ve been dreading since it was being talked about. it’s effecting my family and my husband who is active cg 15y here in nyc. 
consistently with these little ass kissin' bitches. wanna get my attention? do something the fuck about it. 
as i have said before won’t hold my breath. only ones who would ever possibly face jail time are some low level scapegoats. we have seen justice at this level play out to many time before. 
i have never come across such a disrespectful and toxic fandom as the 'zaskia ghotix' fandom (::::: in the end, your fandom represents you, right? never have i come across such a selfish and unfaithful fandom! 
way to go #democrats. nice to know you have the backs of americans. 
my guess, #nfl wants to avoid a "will they or won't they" controversy regarding a championship team visit to the white house. ensuring a patriots sb victory avoids this since #trump is friends with brady, and belicheet thinks he's a great human being 
not watching the sb for the 2nd time ever. blame ne. fuck them dead. 
this is what's wrong with pro sports... and why roger goodell loves playing doll house on super bowl sunday.... even mr official wants to play dollies...

i am fed up with democrats being wussies. stop bending over. it's past time to fight fire with fire. stand up, hold your ground and don't move until you get what you want. the other side has no intention of ever being bi-partisan as long as they are in power.

the need for self-publicity displayed by ken livingstone is sad and pathetic, erring towards the trumpesque. corbyn won’t expel him as they’re cut from the same cloth. a pair of trotskyite dinosaurs who should be put out to pasture.

i know the trumpsters like to explain what the president “means,” but i got this one: when he said he is not a feminist because he is for everyone, what he means is everyone except non-whites, women, gays, trans, and the poor (sure i am forgetting someone). 
we don’t need the likes of him fouling our house with his presence!

look at this... a grown man harassing and bullying a woman. i bet your mother is proud. only a sick twisted #pervert would feel it necessary to insert themselves in another persons marriage and taunt. by your poor judgement, you should be too.

another horrific rape and it's a 8 month old baby girl @ narendramodi - she could have died. you should be ashamed of what your country has become. as a parent, i will never set foot in a country that has such a blatant disregard for it's people - especially females.

i have so much respect for people like @ ericwynalda, @ kylemartino and @ hopesolo. as a fan of the game i have never been more disappointed in u.s. soccer. this whole election was a disgrace & the majority of the voters didn't have a clue.

everyone isn’t ok. physical trauma and emotional trauma does not = ok. how about just speaking truth for a change. thoughts and prayers won’t change a damn thing. the dead are still dead. wounded are still wounded. families still left to deal with the aftermath.

#ashamed 
we won’t forget it either. we must march and fight this corrupt @ gop led administration. republicans only care about their rich donors like the( @ nra ) and not human lives. 
crawl back into that gutter... 
politicians once again show why the us has a school shooting problem by voting down a bill to ban assault rifles … 
so we are about to mass produce bullet proof backpacks instead of changing the gun laws. 
absolutely horrible... no reason for an average person to own a military assault rifle. #smh … 
people, once again saying how horrible our president is. he is the first president to actually get something moving on gun control and you still bash him #liberallogic 
pathetic decision to say the least, emphasizing that they consider weapons more valuable than lives, especailly after such an atrocious act. 17 lives lost, 0 change. …

“arm the teachers” ?!? i can’t believe that’s even being discussed as a “solution” #speechless @ piersmorgan over to you…. 
the nra can go to hell. it would be one thing if the nra had a real principled argument; they don't. they want to sell more guns. arm the teachers....that's not safety argument, that's a sales argument. full stop! 
this needs to be the next metoo movement. jim jordan, nra and all the others need to be broken by the people. the people need to take this country back. the legislators work for us! #disgusted.

@ npr we hold you to a reasonable standard. this is not reasonable balance. … 
another shining example of "leaders" who don't get it. … 
and @ realdonaldtrump has zero emotion. he could absolutely care less... 
i’m sure they all are nra members. 
this was the only person i heard in that room who spoke from the heart, with no obvious penchant for @ realdonaldtrump the rest of the speakers, god bless them, were hand-picked for their adoration of this president. 
oh but let’s show how much money we have that we can destroy something that if it was donated would help so many people. disgusted show celebrities hold themselves to a whole different level #tweettolong #whatnextbrits #toomuchpainandsuffering

so @ foxnewssunday chriswallace is stuck on interpreting military response to chemical weapons as condoning slaughter by conventional warfare. how juvenile. how does this pass for top notch journalism? this is thoughtful analysis/discussion? 
wondering what @ allegiant airlines policy will be for those of us who have bought tickets for future travel and who wish to cancel after watching @ cbsnews @ 60minutes report! i’d rather walk across the country than get in an allegiant plane #safetyfirst 
i recorded the #commonwealthgames2018 closing ceremony but i won’t be watching it now. sorry peter beattie @ smartstate1 an apology isn’t nearly good enough. without athletes there are no games. 
@ optus not impressed when i turn something on in the app (entertainment) that says it's free ($0) and then get a sms telling me thanks for adding a $10 item to my plan. i removed it within an hour once i worked out how but i am at the "bait and switch. #ripoff

i think it should be perfectly acceptable, nay required, to publicly shame people who don’t wash their hands after using the restroom. 
it had everything to do with blind hate, propaganda, and someone who wanted to serve his own purpose by exterminating a whole population using whatever means possible. and i should be doing a paper right now. 
this link is one of the top lines of @ drudge_report right now and note the date of the news story: march 17. yep...makes me think that they knew about all of this weeks ago and saw it coming. …

this was supposed to be a cool, fun and nice way of getting out support for something everyone i know is supporting #20by2020. this is how my elected state officials act on twitter?!?! #done #doyourjobs 
a no win situation? i'm sorry mr #comey, but you worked for the fbi and were tasked to protect the public interest via what we like to call laws. no win implies you have a stake in the game. truth should be the only winner and it lost! enjoy your payday. @ comey

the #trump administration is waging war on the poor … via @ huffpost trump & gop are the party of the rich & power/greed. make the poor suffer more & give it all to the wealthy. so very christian of them. #shameful 
(i rarely tweet...but when i do....) never flying with @ americanair again. worst experience with the worst employees. to start they inconvenience us by overbooking (which is fine, mistakes happen) but the cherry topper is the repulsive attitude of the employees. 
yeah our halifax explosion isn't anything to joke about, ppl lost lives alot of lives! @ jimmykimmel @ roblowe some things just aren't laughable! 
all that taxpayer money wasted by this corrupt administration for private jets, soundproof booths, expensive furniture, and so on and so on, could have paid for a brand new electrical system in puerto rico. #shameful #disgraceful

i am worried that india may again be a slave of british. why modi runs away outside every now and then. india is disgusted by rapes of kids as low as 7 and 8 years. his own mlas are in jail for rape and harassment.

"consider" ok that will be a no then ! there should be no "consider" they need compensated for being treated so badly #inhumane and ruining their lives @ theresa_may and @ amberruddhr need to resign now !!! 
the story is that trump hated obama so much he hired hookers to urinate on the bed where president obama and first lady michelle slept. his birther movement started this nation downhill. every day trump is in office, we slide a little further down. 
i was discriminated against by arab muslims and a white and black woman allowed it to happen to stand by another woman. i am utterly with this country right now.

as a us navy veteran, i am appalled by this news. we have never had a worse commander in chief. 
@ americanair i am disgusted! my 83-year-old father was travelling last night and was feeling cold and there was no blanket for him; he had his usual jacket on however the air-conditioning was so cranked up

@ daciauk shoddy customer service. i will be taking my custom elsewhere and letting everyone i know the appalling treatment i have received.

one of my buddies summed up the music scene perfectly. “the musicians are awesome, the lead singers are jerks, and the creeps running around behind the scenes are jokers” amen to that 
being spokeswoman for nra doesn’t mean that you are saying anything worth listening to. wearing glasses doesn’t make you sound or look more intelligent. saying an ar 15 is not technically an assault rifle doesn’t make being blown to bits by one any less awful.

thanks @ amymwhyte i have read the email and frankly i am at the lies i have been told and will be asking @ ameyplc for disciplinary action to be taken on the members of staff that stood and lied to our faces. @ broadheathward you should be ashamed for taking no action

her mindset disturbs me greatly. what if the man had money, and his card gets frozen or something due to someone using his money and the bank noticed. this why a lot of woman are selfish. you can’t just assume just cause his card declines, that it means he’s broke. 
@ theresa_may #shameon @ ukparliament

i'm sure many, if they had the funds, would be on the first plane outta here! i would! there's certainly no 'great' in britain anymore - not for #50swomen / #backto60 women! #dumpedonfromagreatheight 
when will all this hate stop??? the country needs to move forward 
@ lovewilko thanks for the environmentally friendly way you wrap purchases. a few brushes and you used 50 metres of #plastic wrap. #wtf 
@ capitals really? can’t buy playoff tickets because i live in pa? i am a season ticket holder for the #hersheybears. #pathetic #capsaremyteam 
do nothing, neo-liberal bs! pompeo ppl?! i just can't even right now. … 
thanks @ firstbsa no 2 service just left college green without me - i’m literally knocking on the door - i use a stick for walking because of injured knee and driver looked at me turned away and drove off.

#abominable to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men. fuck you 이규형 
it's crazy how i was just discussing rape yesterday (before bill cosby was found guilty) and the girl was telling about guys from a frat raped this girl and i had no idea. today a guy (member of the exact frat) was triggered by my ig post and it all made sense! 
@ asklloydsbank @ lloydsbankbiz @ lbfew no massive shock that the promise of a technical problem resolution would be sorted didn't happen, and that yet again it was me chasing you. you keep letting @ fahrbeyond down! #poorservice @ bbchealth @ gdnhealthcare @

#bradpitt working on a film about #harveyweinstein good friends stick together, don't they? 
@ agjeffbsessions please explain 2 we the people just why @ comey is getting away with leaking classified information? there are 2 justice systems in america now. one 4 elites & one 4 regular citizens. i really thought a man of your honor would fight against the #swamp. 
want to look good and say they will call to talk about it but you never hear a word. 
it's a shame #seriea #interjuve is not broadcasted live in india instead wwe live events have taken over the sony ten network. 
if i, a 32yo american white woman, can be so completely disgusted, maddened and feel so powerless by this, i cannot even begin to fathom what my black neighbors, brothers, and sisters are feeling. #done #enoughisenough

@ sainsburys you really need to train all your staff to be first aid trained. can’t believe what was experienced just a few minutes ago at your ladbroke grove superstore #suggeston #helpsavelives 
perhaps @ michaelgove would like to wear one of these collars to see how it feels? #barbaric … 
i am so disgusted with this. you are now charging £25 for our 15 month olds membership, increase of 127%! how can this be justified? how do you expect to get/keep young fans? shouldn’t you be making it as accessible as possible for our future fans? #beyondajoke 
until we truly act like #blacklivesmatter, we cannot insist that all lives matter... dig? we need to stand up and speak out and stop allowing the minority of white people make the rest of us look like monsters! #unitedshades season 2 ep. 2 @ wkamaubell #humanrace

#vickyphelan what a woman! how could you not feel real deep anger! #beatcancer

joy ann reid said some horrible, unforgivable shit about my community. a community that has been forever under fire. and now, b/c she's being called out again on it, she's all "i can't remember" + "i'm so $ orry". f*** that. i may never vote dem again. 
i was excited to see last thursday that @ mammothscreen chose to film on my patch at garston coastal reserve in liverpool for the new “war of the worlds” ...for @ bbc shame on you , that you didn’t take away the pallets that you brought to sit on 
lake ronkonkoma, going through some $ h*+ right now. they've (effectively) closed down one of our two north-south commuter bridges, and are tearing up our train line. i know it is all for progress. how about repaving our roads? #stressed 
it's a terrible look for #msm and all media... guess everyone's afraid of losing their access. … 
@ virginmedia don’t offer great deals for existing customers. my mum has been with them 8 years with the same ancient box and they want her to pay more to get a working one 
i can never trust any avatar on here... fake people so annoying even guys are the game players in this shii.... 
@ mustbepearls i was appalled when i seen your comments and there is actually someone that has a channel hxmber and it is monetized as well and they have your content in every video. like how? 
can we start training police to tell the difference between a cell phone (something almost everyone carries) and a gun (something not almost everyone carries)? the two objects do not even look alike, but since it keeps happening, i guess they need a refresher course. 
so why is okay to tear another woman down? she’s a hard working, professional, and intelligent woman. you don’t have to like her politics but this treatment was disgusting wrong and not even funny...wasn’t a roast it was a verbal assault 
the same high road dems have been taking hasn’t been working much, so a little low, just like the republicans proudly display, coming from a comedian, is peanuts in comparison. i think she represented a majority of how people feel about trump. 
@ bbcnews you are promoting 'gaming with an under 16 year old playing an 18 or over game, it's illegal.... #gamingdestroyslives 
sitting on the train listening to girls laughing at her ex boyfriend crying and feeling suicidal because they broke up.. “he’s mental health” it’s disgusting they find someone else’s pain funny. #mentalhealth is not a thing you joke about nor is someone’s pain #youth 
they know nothing will happen to them so they continue to intimidate and show utter contempt for britain and the real british citizens #notinmycountry #khanout

@ asda it's struggle enough to get a 12year old to eat all their vegetables during dinner but when she bites into a sugar snap pea and discovers a dead baby caterpillar it's put her off eating frozen veg from asda or anything peas for that matter!

a short list of individuals who need to be voted out of office - how they could say that trump has devoted himself tirelessly to peace is amazing. the only things he has devoted himself to tirelessly are (1) golfing, (2) grifting from us treasury, and (3) tweeting 
a convicted criminal - someone who abused his office, mistreated those in his care, demeaned prisoners, and showed no respect for the rule of law. #pence #worstvicepresidentever (and that is saying a lot!). we cannot normalize either miscreant - 
oh puh-leeze! the lengths you go to justify treason! 
@supportpetadopt another one for you to share. #sad …

as an eagle scout, i am offended by the decision to include girls. that's what girl scouts was for. all this "gender neutral" bullshit is completely out of hand. i formally withdrew my name from the eagle scout registry last year when this decision was made. 
greens stood candidates in all 18 of my local wards. they didn’t campaign, they didn’t knock on doors the didn’t produce leaflets. they did however split the vote enabling an unimpressive tory who didn’t campaign . to get in.

how classless of a reporter to disturb this solemn and respectful assembly.. and the media wonders why people are disgusted with them.

while @ speakerryan @ senatemajldr @ housegop @ senategop stand silently complicit. history will tell the story of how @ gop destroyed our democracy & possibly the world. but hey, they got richer along the way & probably think they’ll survive in their bunkers. #gopcomplicit 
congrats trump, you’ve put the wishes of saudi arabia over the safety of the region, the wishes of our allies in europe and the recommendation of your own secretary of defense. 
why do men hit/abuse women, especially those they are supposed to care about and love? come and try to hit a real man, see how that works out for you. #abuse #seesomethingsaysomething 
how can this worthless con man remain in office and his followers continue to support him when his job is to keep the american people safe and he has done nothing to do that! hurry up mueller. #muellerinvestigation 
@ maddow why would @ msnbc allow previously banned roger stone on their network to push his book? 
@ realdonaldtrump never has a heart attack when we want him too. ah well. if it happens in jail that’s fine too. #nevertrump 
i am with our current state of #politics & how #educated people from every party/persuasion use the same bs tactic #whataboutism to avoid thoughtful philosophical argument & to justify their own "sins." big reason i avoid most social media & wonder why i came … 
get over yourself. real patriots have fought and died to protect and defend the constitution. so don't use those poor kids as your propaganda to undermine people like myself who have paid a price for this country. 
this southern baptist #texan is and … 
reading the tweets from @ howardstern interview w/ @ iamcardib prove to me just how ignorant people can be about anyone different from what they are use to, a bunch of racist, prejudice people bashing him for having her on and being open minded, and disrespecting her... 
@ lowe’s ruined my kitchen. how was i not informed, a) when i made my purchase b) over the last several days that my sink i just had a counter temp later for will be on backorder until july 21st? #badbusiness 
right - the same john rizzo who, due to a kidney stone, sat out the vietnam war - so f**king tired of all these armchair warriors who happily inflict harm on others, put our own people in danger and never served! - you are a disgrace!

@ ask_spectrum as usual, 6 pm rolls around, people come home, turn on their computers, and the internet slows to a crawl. can't stream anything. pages take forever. spectrum can't handle the volume. worse than when it was twc. #badservice

@ lethalweaponfox cant replace @ claynecrawford bottom line, if no @ claynecrawford i wont be watching. just cancel the show. hell in my mind it already is.

this super old dude licked his lips at me (if that’s a thing) i never felt so ugly in my life #willthisdaygetbetter #willthisyeargetbetter 
it’s like groundhog day. day 2 another failed delivery. come on...get it together! #useless #poorservice 
that's being generous..... i think it's more like dems bring emotional support dogs to gunfights. 
w/ @ tandcmag especially in this day & age, for the audacity, unmitigated gall to uninvite @ monicalewinsky who was so victimized by the media etc for her relationship w @ billclinton #shame on town & country magazine u could have found a better way #timesup #metoo 
liz, shut up till you can say something that resembles intelligence. when did it become so hard to do the “right” thing rather than just want to hear yourself spew bs!! #hack 
#newindia folks,so regressive that women will be forced to go back to gender roles. i can’t imagine how a child will feel about random strangers forcing to remove inner wear. i mean in a country where sex education is nil, body shaming is tool by men to abuse women … 
a lineup fiasco?!!? no surprise given the last week of ineptitude. unbelievable! welcome to another season of met baseball! poor offense, vargas, gonzalez, shakey bullpen and no help in the minors. #someonebuythemets 
none of these people in the trump administration are fit to wipe john mccain’s boots! is this what melania was talking about in her be best program?? #hypocrites 
the caca is so deep from this republican administration if it gets stirred anymore the smell will be from the entire gop. 
smfh cant trust no1 … 
i’m not joking when i say bring back the death penalty. there is no hope for our kids when they know our laws will let them get away with anything. we need to scare them shitless so they behave not send them to a 5 star accomodation. #myopinion @ theheraldsun 
#hesdyinganyway so proud of you for supporting @ potus cabinets jokes about @ senjohnmccain 
@kellysadler45 bad day to be you. #hesdyinganyway this is the new @ gop #horrifying … 
i didn't think a new kind of low was possible for this administration, but sadly it is. 
"special assistant kelly sadler made the derisive comments during a closed-door white house meeting of about two-dozen communications staffers. “it doesn’t matter, he’s dying anyway,” @kellysadler45 said, according to a source familiar with the remarks at the meeting." … 
pre-trump, such lying wasn't tolerated. lying to the american people would result in someone getting fired, reputations ruined, careers ended, etc. these ppl aren't 'mistaken.' they know the truth & deliberately lie to get what they want. 
some people ought to be ashamed of themselves! how can you advocate something, then make a complete mockery of it by publicly taking the piss?! #notamusing 
@ rbs @ hsbc @ asknationwide if i’ve learned anything from today’s saga is the uk banking sector is accountable for nothing,blameless, uncaring, selfish, and nasty. you don’t just “lose” £49,000 of 78 yr old pensioners cash & pan them off with “we don’t know where it is” 
this is the attitude of duty of care that #adf, #pharma 60p and @ gsk place on their trial subjects. no longitudinal follow up and denial of any responsibility. @ us_fda - v poor pharmacovigilance. @ mefloq_vets_aus @ rarassn @ yourdefence @ stuartmccarthy_ @ … 
no, #whiteamerica needs to calm dafuq down. “afternoon racial sensitivity training” is not only a bandaid on the cancer of #racism, it’s also a pr move. … 
love the look of @ kirstenpowers face at break r/t following the money. 
neither 60p or @ gsk has undertaken any longitudinal follow-up with these trial subjects, despite requests to do so, so they have no basis of knowledge at all to make this statement. this ignorance puts other lives at risk. #disgusted. 
honestly i’m disgusted #wehavetodobetter #wow … 
@ cityofcincy gee, you bunch of worthless idiots are at it again. really-bumpstocks? how about reducing crime/saving neighborhoods? #pos 
wow, trump admin. blaming the green berets that were killed in niger on, guess who? the soldiers themselves. can these degenerates get anymore despicable and cowardly? i guess us not recovering the pieces of there bodies is hillary's fault.

seriously what insurance is affordable for non-mega company employee, pre-existing conditions, not aca, military or state qualified. in other words...middle class forgotten people insurance? this administration (nor others) care about nothing but the politics. #sad and … 
but how can they fire her when djt has also targeted sen mccain & many others with equally horrific ridicule? normalizing dehumanization of enemies is what this administration is all about.

@ terrysheehanmp maybe you can explain to this soldier, who put his life on the line for us, canadians, yet you and your party have allowed terrorists, whom these soldiers have fought against, into our country to live free and clear? we, deserve answers! … 
i, just did the same thing! @ att gone!!

@ cinepolis @ indiacinepolis #cinepolisjaipur sadly most pathetic, filthy, unhygienic, smelly theatre. no one complains, hence taken for granted. i do have some standards and expect the same if i am paying. atleast sweep the hall between shows. 
@ starbucks service at ft. lauderdale international is super slow! i would’ve passed out waiting for the mooches in there to serve me! had to go elsewhere. 
i just cleaned my makeup vanity and i'm at how much dirt came off. bleh! 
@kellysadler45 as someone whose mother, at 57 is battling glioblastoma you should be ashamed of yourself! apologize for your hurtful and ignorant comment! @ meghanmccain @ potus 
so @ bravotv @ andy has rehired phaedra parks.....that's it. no more #rhoa for me. 
i thought you lot loved your guns for this exact reason? isn’t that why you hate the students protesting the @ nra ? oh wait, sorry no, you just hate black people. sorry my mistake white america... i hope the attention gets her freed soon. … 
here’s the sad truth: companies in lebanon think that their employees are very bright and must know about everything so why waste time training them? and you know the funny part that i have 2 ba’s and i couldn’t find a job in neither of them and i m so frustrated !!

because amerikkka is beyond racist! 
@ chasesupport 4/27 account hacked. 4/28 filed report w/chase. 5/7 went to police (per chase) same day chase decides not their problem. 5/10 have to go into branch to learn chase no longer investigating. 30 years down drain. #noloyalty from chase. 
to me that's just messed up. in what world would anyone be ok with that? you hold your mom's hand with those twitter fingers. 
when i seen this on the news i couldn’t help but believe this despicable @ johnkerry had created such a traitorous act against a country and a sitting president! these are true low times that the #libtards will stoop. #maga #americafirst

people like the utterly inept @ stevebarclay need to be made an example of and sacked without recourse or compensation!

i am truly

@ surreycouncil thanks to a massive pothole my tyre was literally ripped from the wheel rim am so sick of hitting potholes around here i’ve replaced tyres before but this was an entire rim. i’ve had to fork out a fortune i can’t afford 
the fact they’ve not even acknowledged this shows either a) their communication style or b) they have a lot of complaints to deal with, which would be unsurprising 
this is like punching yourself in the face before the bully can do it to you. i implore the @ senatedems to pick a new leader. but of course they won't. because that would take showmanship, grit and chutzpah, not dependable qualities in a democratic senator. #gaza 
provoke, incite conflicts, watch ppl killed, celebrate. trump is the master of con politics: … #palestine

oh stop yourself really. do you now feel better??!?! poking people in pain???? and quite frankly you don’t “feel sorry” per your tweet. people like you pollute social media! and... frankly “humility” is the last thing @ senjohnmccain & @ meghanmccain need right now … 
the tories never believed in devolution and today confirmed they still don't believe in devolution but happily take up seats in our scottish parliament and take a salary. tories in scotland #giveupyourseatsnow none of you deserve to be there ! 
i stand with palestine. the brutalization and murder of peaceful protesters is outrageous. israel is a proxy of the us and the u.s. should stand in shame at the authorized behavior and criminal behavior of its proxy. 
@ gofundme i'm pulling my campaign from your business because you have allowed someone to start a campaign against the most beautiful dogs out there which are pit bulls. you know how many dogs will die because of this idiot? 
either @ jaysonbraddock or @ realseanjones was a total sexist pig to a female caller yesterday. she called to say harden was going to have a big game and one of them said “is that what he said when you woke up with him this morning?!” really?! women know sports too.

i see a lot of people in congress and the senate wringing their hands over this president but nothing changes. 
this is not a liberal agenda just racists feeling entitled to do as they please because they consider themselves the master race. …

they are not in power, we are years from a ge. wtf is a minister blathering on about the opposition who cannot implement anything so have no actual policy. clearly you are unable to argue or justify your own policy, so misdirecting, grow up and do your actual job.

right, so after a rare week of pretty much just sunshine in lovely manchester/leeds, i am going to a conference in switzerland. where the weather forecast says it will be cold and rainy - all week. 
maybe you could take steps to deal with your commissioners meeting secretly with @ bell at the same time in order to screw the public? or is that all just daily routine for ian scott? #cdnpoli 
@johnlewisretail went into the liverpool store today to look for royal wedding merchandise only to be told by your lovely liverpool staff that the royal wedding souvenirs are only in your southern stores! what a terrible assumption by you john lewis.

this is absolutely disgraceful @ thamesvp, these officers should hang their heads in shame. where’s their humanity? …

i'm confused as to why instagram and twitter are blowing up with people posting baby pictures of those kardashian babies asking "which one is prettier?" or "why doesn't kylie's baby look like travis scott?" she has 2 damn parents. and leave them the hell alone. 
correction. @ sentedcruz preys on the people, not prays for the people. pimping other peoples pain for votes. #enoughisenough 
@ tedcruz should be an evangelical preacher. he does nothing but deliver sermons, and is so unbelievably insincere. let's not forget while i'm at it, the hundreds of thousands he gets from his masters the nra. #disgusted. 
i guess decorum is out the window. this guy showed up at the scene of the school shooting today with an american flag, a maga hat and a gun saying he was there to show support. what the actual fuck? #cantmakethisshitup 
did anyone connect the fact that in it's 13th season of ancient aliens - podesta featured within one minute airtime? 13th season .. symbols, numbers etc.. with #ancientaliens @ saraashcraft @ lizcrokin … 
so, apparently the @ forsa_union_ie conference this week decided to “not take a position” on the upcoming referendum. we are in total shock. most of the @ sw4choice crew + a lot of #socialworkers are forsa union members. this news has shaken us to the core. #repealthe8th

absolutely. trump wouldn’t be able to wreak havoc but for his sycophants in the media & the gop. 
that moment when the sunday @ nytimes puts the royal wedding on the front page above the fold and pushes the article about the ongoing slaughter of american school children to page 20. #priorities #guncontrolnow 
hindus - men, women, and children - got brutalized for 800 yrs via this "peace of muhammad." either the pm has not read history well, or has read it well but doesn't care about hindus' feelings... which continue to be his captive voterbase. 
he is a meddlesome con man and a national disgrace. 
“we”? you are not building cultural bridges all over the world. you create dissent and unnecessarily interject racism (such as at a wedding-just celebrate the moment, al) into every discussion as you chase power and $$. 
i remember running into his parents quite a bit in their restaurant when i lived in seattle. they were genuinely proud of him, of course, and by now they must just be heartbroken and dismayed - along with the rest of us. and not over those ridiculous crocs either.

i have never been treated so poorly by multiple @ flyfrontier staff. what a horrible experience. was here 2 and 1/2 hours early to wait in line for 2 hours to check one bag and to be screamed at multiple times. almost missed my flight. #ijustwanttogohome 
i am to the point where i'm surprised if they don't hold on to any lead, especially in the 8th or 9th inning. 
finally a bottom has been reached. 
with #redlobster worse service ever! they weren’t busy, waited over 15 minutes from soup 2 entree. they brought meal to table, waitress reached across the table with melted butter in a small cup on a plate & it flew off plate onto my clothes! #never #going there 
if votes are ignored we're no better than any tinpot dictatorship anywhere in the world. cant believe we have british mps who are anti democratic. 
just wondering how many of the recent 'amazing' reviews on the lush facebook page have been left by their staff! reassured to see so many people supporting the actual amazing work of the police force. #flushlush 
good god, wtf is happening to us??? i had to snopes this bc it sounded like bot info yet, it’s true … 
damn you @ delta you should be ashamed of your poor service. a dog dying because of you shows complete lack of #compassion . i'm awfully by you #boycottdelta 
when i read articles like this, i am reminded of being in the 6th grade in 1985 and learning about the apartheid laws for 'pass books'. 'you know why the lady called the police’: black people face 911 calls for innocuous acts … 
my 16yr old is currently walking home from pontypool as the number 15 she catches every week at 18.40 from trevethin shops has only gone as far as pontypool instead of dropping off in lowlands pontnewydd cwmbran 
indeed. thanks for throwing us into his waiting arms. we expected better than this from you and we could not be more disappointed. arrogance is an terrible thing. we’ll be paying for yours for years while suffering a ford govt. 
israel knows no one will punish them for committing war crimes why are they targeting medics wth if it wasn’t for murikkka backing them up other counties would actually pressure them to not act like criminals … 
unreal you can’t give a straight up answer to the fans about not opening the arena! #shameful #willstayhome #noheatathome 
i really dont understand why men think its ok to ask a girl to leave everything behind her to go build with them but then behave like piece of shit and spread their seeds across the globe. #jenaimarredeshommes 
because our media has completely f’d up priorities. @ cnn and @ fareedzakaria are too busy promoting steve bannon. 
i read about this guy and am just waiting for trump to endorse him as a fine family man. 
@ kathygriffin is such a disgrace, how can any women condone such hateful and disgusting words about another women. i don’t care what difference you have with someone these words should never be used when talking about someone #doublestandard 
“since october, hundreds of children have been taken from their parents at the border and put in separate facilities.” #keepfamiliestogether #endfamilyseparation … 
saddened by the media focus on what the female soap stars were wearing last night, rather than celebrating their talent & hard work. but this one is really disgusting @ thesun asking a 17 year old “to have a bit of fun and flash some flesh”. 
@ windows your update has ruined my computer. i’ve probably lost 2-4 years of my life. so thanks. 
holy @ itunes wtf does an 8year old need tinder to be advertised on their itunes app store for? don’t you think that these adverts and ‘suggestions’ should be age appropriate? 
the lying, false statements and ridiculous comments will continue. why can't @ realdonaldtrump be stopped? "what's the point of us tweeting our displeasure", if congress can't give america some kind of answer? #tiredofthelies #americafirst 
maybe you could help me with this? everybody says vote vote vote go out and vote! i have since i was able to. here’s where i need a little help, why are we gonna bother when russia can interfere or whomever with our election process? signed... in america 
#trump comparing the doj & the fbi to nazi storm-troopers needs to be pushed back by any right thinking member of congress. what the hell is wrong with them or trump? as he and they know better & this is inexcusable. stop tearing down our government & public servants. 
unacceptable that a multitude of women’s voices over a span of 3 decades have been ignored and silenced. this is a sick world. we need to stop invalidating each other’s voices and listen up! #outraged …

i’m sooo done with @ united airlines. stuck on a hot plane in the florida heat for an hour then over 12 hours in a airport while the reps blamed each other. had to rebook for the next day and missed a day of work

@ mta i want to understand the logic!! i am here at williamsbridge rd and pelham parkway bus stop bay plaza. i had to watch not one but 2 bx12sbs come at the exact same time. i went to get a ticket and they both drove off! i now have to wait 12 minutes for another one. 
i'm so mad that my favorite website @ boohoo sent my heels in the wrong size. 
i absolutely detest people who like to show off. 
@ tgowdysc imagine your response if obama had said that he could pardon himself. imagine if obama had a special council investigating hm and he claimed it to be unconstitutional. where is your voice? 
well 2 of his besties are pedophiles so .... birds of a feather you know the rest .. as my dad would say .. 
we wait a lifetime for a #superbowl win #superbowlchampions, we finally win and @ eagles just blew it up and embarrassed us all, for egos. #eagles

@ ian_knightly a;kljdf 
i don’t wish for those responsible to burn in hell. i wish for them to burn in the very real hell that took so many lives in that building.... 
another ‘lose lose’ situation for police. they work to the rules they get @ thetodayshow berating that they didn’t stop a ‘possible’ incident. if they had stopped it and courts found that they had insufficient evidence to intervene you still would have berated them. 
instead of partaking in sensationalism style journalism how about “serious bus crash on hwy 401 near prescott. 30-40 injured. if you’re in the area drive safe. we will keep you posted as we learn more”. 
you ever look back and get by the turn of events with a person, place, or thing? 
so that’s it? we are just going to be a fascist dictatorship now? are you fucking serious? just fuck everyone. 
watching #panorama #tessajowell how can we have the lowest survival rate for cancer in western europe.........that's disgusting.........having lost my mum to cancer , i do wonder , what if 
@ hugobossservice you have just lost a very loyal customer because of this! #disappointed #angry 
honestly @ peelschools when parents have issues with their children and teachers like this; had you taken them seriously the first time this would not happen. #prayingmyboysnvrhavetodealwithteacherslikethis #protectblackchildren … 
aparantly they can afford better holidays by letting her children fly economy whilst they fly business class. how about you fly economy in that case kirsty and have more holidays and spend time with your kids... #winwin #shocked … 
it's like they have a f**king short memory. sometime they behave so pathetic it's hard to fathom.

@ zenithhome - very poor service and still waiting since march for our door to be properly fitted 
good read by @ deoneroberts. #wallstreet bank ( @ bofa_news) makes #homeowners lose homes so it can make more #profit. … 
doesn't anyone just own their own behavior? didn't we learn that in grade school? like @ senatemajldr mcconell can't just say no august break? it has to be an insult to @ senatedems ? can we just require govt. officials to at least be adults? 
what kind of us president doesn’t know the words to this song?! you, sir, are an idiot! @ realdonaldtrump #getreal … 
wow! and you know the girls (who were dancing to earn legitimate income- if you know what that means) are prostitutes, how? 
i love you and your opinions @ chrissyteigen #corruptpresident #russiancollusion … 
don’t bother responding - you’ve done enough - and i have no more time for u - if u do - i won’t answer ! 
this absolutely sickens me .lets all get together and find these poor little pups and their mums .as for the scum yes scum that stole them hope that they rot .make their lives hell .please retweet and sickened … 
they said that the media would stoop to their lowest right before the ig report dropped; i guess they weren't kidding!! … 
it's total fuckery!!! i come to twitter to see if your live or put out a new video. 
@ presssec just trashed the media - again. she was disrespectful, unfair and abjectly rude. and i am so bloody sick of ‘the president has said very clearly.’ she claims to have more cred than the press - and no one called her out on it! c’mon! stand up to her! call me 
i get so tired of this double-edged negative stereotype of black men--that they must be doing those things & not black if they carry themselves well. smh. 
honestly, go check the updates. you have no idea about the accusations you are throwing about. far from a scam #falseaccusations 
the faces tell it all! #embarrasing … 
wow. this got my blood boiling. what piece of shits think this is ever ok?? he was unarmed. yes he refused to sit but that does not give those “officers” the right to beat the shit out of him or anyone for that matter. #disgraceful … 
our country is a reality show #dumptrump 
@sears here i am again having to follow up with you - this really should be the other way around. it’s been well over 48 hours..... checked my post office box today - no replacement parts. no email, no tweets, no phone call, no texts. what is going on at sears? 
where are your papers? does that sound familiar? when they come for the last of the least and there is no one to stand up for them they will know how it feels. this is the america we have become. 
@ boohoo you should be ashamed of yourselves for pitching this beautiful, normal, averaged size woman as plus size. i’m #disgusted. she’s barely a size 12. images with labels like this are what cause woman to feel insecure about themselves. 
this is incredibly infuriating and disturbing. these police officers, yes multiple officers, brutally attacked and knocked out an unarmed black man. they need to be charged for their actions and stat. … 
this must be the "whatever" place.... … 
that’s even worse than the video i’ve seen previously. absolutely no need for any of that. the level of violence used on one man. no more than thugs in uniform!!! 
ms jenkyns you should be ashamed by accusing #the3million and #britishineu of scaremongering..i was shocked by your statement watching this morning. these forums have been supporting,fighting for the rights of over 4mil people. no wonder we rather leave uk. 
@ sixers does the organization really care that little about its fan base? 
i have no words! what a totally and completely messed up story line!!! this is disgusting! #7delaan 
how pathetic a network can be!! @ vodafonein switching to some other network. no network can be as worse as vodafone!! 
i’m seething to come home and find my teaching wife has been verbally abused again by a parent who is already on a ban from school. what other options have schools used or have you heard about. #protectteachers 
what. the. actual. hell?!? inappropriate on so many levels 
in 25 years work with @ southmeadproj i thought i had a good idea of what children have been facing but collated stats for my book has shocked me so much, making me even more determined to challenge the status quo. innocent victims of crime being virtually ignored 
huh? is this for real? who in their right mind would publish this? are you sure this isn't a hoax??? 
sick to see a poor girl get her phone pick pocketed by a man getting off @ luas four courts tonight. surely some security might help stop these situations happening?? #vulnerable #safetyfirst 
i just witnessed a grown ass woman pack a lip on purpose to get sick and get out of work i am

@ scarborocouncil @ everyoneactive @ swim_england @ sn_sport @ thescarboronews the big plan for learning to swim in scarborough looks like it’s working...not what a waste of pool time when there’s so many children wanting to learn with their local club. 
it isn't about what kind of clothes you wear or ain't wearing at all, it has never been. because if by any chance you're naked, they're gonna give you an oblivious stare with utmost consciousness, drooling and lecherous eyesight. and jerk off anyway. 
@ sdjsfl spoken to a pumas manager tonight who's devastated, a new team has taken several of his players. he knew this before 1st june. no doubt they will enter league. makes me wonder if it's worthwhile. all the effort we go to and with ease this happens! 
just got a peek into the physicians lounge at the hospital as i was walking by...donuts, pastries, refined garbage #ironic #beanexample #healthcare 
animal cruelty is never okay, it doesn’t make you more of a “man” nor is it a topic to take so lightly. stop minimizing the issue like its acceptable, and stop turning it into a joke. 
trump spent time assuring cabinet members they were very popular, but failed to mention a new estimate that nearly 5,000 deaths may be linked to hurricane maria. … #fema #puertorico #trump cares so little about american lives selfish 2 his core 
had a guy tell me he only hits on girls who wear “sexy” clothes to the gym. he said because they’re there to get a man not workout. no, maybe her “sexy” outfit is a cute one that she wore for herself while she goes and works on herself 
roseanne grabbing her crotch & shrieking the national anthem. trumper reaction: she's so funny!!! peaceful/lawful protest re unfair police treatment for persons of color. trumper reaction: disrespecting our flag/anthem/vets/police/freedoms/!!!! #fakeoutrage #turnofffox

when is the right time then, @ johncornyn? when? … 
never ever judge. suicide is not selfish. it comes from a place of pain/despair that luckily most people can never imagine. you should be ashamed of yourself. you didn’t have to say anything at all. clearly missing the empathy gene. what a sad pitiful man you are. 
trump doesn’t have to prep for kim the outcome has already been decided by putin. trump is now playing for the other side we are the bad guys. @ gop you do nothing 
@ loveisland eyall has no and @hayleyhughes_xx is just a slimy woman and all that acting dumb is cringeeeeee #loveisland

disgusted at the behavior of the @ checkerssa stellenbosch branch manager. she basically has zero professionalism. i believe that a cleaner should be treated with the same respect the ceo of @ checkerssa gets, thats my motto in life. 
nothing is off limits when it comes to clickbait anymore. cultural icon kills himself and publications cant help themselves to drive page views in such a juvenile and callous fashion. 
i went shopping for some clothes earlier this week...then 2 days later i realized the lady put them in a plastic bag... i can't believe this can still happen to me ! i choked up and just sat on my couch unable to do anything for 10 solid minutes !! #noplasticchallenge

@ houseoffraser absolutely disgusted with the service tonight my daughter bought dad t-shirt now been reduced won’t give the difference in price as we hit 28 days yesterday no wonder stores are closing should have purchased it it ted baker direct #poorcustomerservice 
it's sickening watching as trump shows such disrespect and indifference to our allies @ emmanuelmacron and @ justintrudeau but shows such devotion to putin. 
almost the entire republican congress who once abhorred trump, are selling the soul of america out and abandoning our core principles for their hatred of a black man who became president. 
who r the 18k people who liked this imbecilic & disrespectful tweet? and r they motivated by hatred or ignorance... or both? 
shame on you @ publix @ publixhelps for supporting #putnam for govenor. for over 25 years i have shopped exclusively at #publix. seems i need to find another grocery store. #resist 
@ justintrudeau i am so angry!! please don’t ever give in to this bully!!! stay the road please...how dare you - @ realdonaldtrump - come 2 our country & simper & joke & threaten - & then safely gone, tweet this about our pm 4 sake of your base. #bully #cowardly … 
that tyson fury fight was an absolute joke, i would have preferred to watch what was going on in the crowd. tyson needs to start taking things serious now or no one will take him serious

#overpolicing … 
breaks my heart this kind of stuff. leisure centre managers probably pay more than £30 a week for tea, coffee, milk, sugar and electric for the kettle. they’re obviously had a meeting and gone for the most vulnerable person.

@ morrisons do you think this is acceptable! bought this afternoon in your downham market store and not the first time your garlic has been inedible!!! sort yourselves out!! 
absolutely disgraceful @ ticketmasteruk @ ticketmastercs good tickets are bought in good faith and then you completely screw over the the customer by swapping the seats for the crap ones you can’t sell. and not forgetting the 3 hours travel and cost of the overnight stay … 
horrified to see those officers being attacked.the entire country thanks them for their bravery and wishes a speedy recovery watching those officers has inspired me to finally apply to the specials, hopefully the beginning of my career #bespecial @ cheshpolsc #police 
truly a sad commentary of what is going on in this admin. and sickened. 
i completely agree. they are always so quick to demote this kid, while big $ players fail to contribute. #timetobecomeayankeefan 
funny how you care about that which has nothing to do with you. also come out of the personal pocket of the one terminating the pregnancy. but you help pay to dehumanize these kids but that's ok right. they never should have come right. #fuckboynation 
@ thomascookcares @ thomascookuk - 5 disconnected live help chats #thomascookaretheworst #worstcustomercare #thomascook

clearly something (like the definitions of dignity & diplomacy) got lost in translation. i believe what this @ whitehouse official meant to say was: "we're russia's bitch." trump official: ‘we’re america, bitch’ is administration’s doctrine: …

wow. . . so twitter can just lock you out 100% until you delete a tweet they don't like. that's the most anti american/anti free speech bs i've ever encountered. #mylasttweetever 
reading that article made me almost throw up; no joke. i felt physically ill. is this what we've come to? thankfully we still have people such as yourself, who speak up so eloquently on behalf of our side. but this? i just can't...i. just. can't. 
this imprisonment, because that is what it is, will scar these children for life. this is inhumane they are caged like animals.

i’m so frustrated.. what’s with all the passes backwards and sideways? 
timely post. is this the premise for why children are being ripped from their families and held in detention like centers. 
this administration is leveraging innocent children (they did not choose this) for votes to build a useless wall. that money would be better spent in technology that would actually help border security and reform immigration. #thisnationisbetterthanthis

really @ washingtonpost ? you had to devote half of the sports section on father's day to @ lavarbigballer ?

let me guess. we were about to be kicked out anyway because of the abuses currently being committed. #disgusting #ashamed 
where’s the compassion for the kids? i thought republicans were the party who cared so much about “the family.” the hypocrisy becomes more apparent every day in the cult of trump.

this is dead serious the look coop gives uncle k8 
i can't believe that people are trying to justify this cruelty by pointing out how other countries handle illegal immigration. no this isn't a "lesser of two evils" kind of thing.this is just evil.this is cruel and inhumane. and it's exactly what you wanted, isn't it? 
yup. this is the country where you want to live the america dream, but this is the kind of ppl who doesn’t want anyone to live that dream because you’re a immigrant #sadworld … 
kids are the future ... a significant part of it obviously ... and it’s sad in many various cases they’re suffering at the hands of an adult .... be it the president or a bitter baby momma. how selfish . 
and the ass kissing continues.... way to go @ gop for turning a meeting into a reality show where everyone praises the "star!" 
beauty of social media is that eventually the inner door is left open and the world sees you for who you really are @ lord_sugar …

best ex. i can point at to prove we need more funding for ed: ed cos & admins ad nauseum post coaching ideas like "say hi to kids & thank you to colleagues". do we care so little about kids that someone who needs to be taught basic social skills is hired to teach kids? 
this is not teaching and is now pure indoctrination. i would be livid as a parent! they can't even manage to teach reading, writing and arithmetic yet have time to indoctrinate our children on sexual perversion being an accepted forms of behavior. … 
wow @ ussoccer_wnt disappointed in your choice to allow #hinkle to play. it is a privledge and honor to represent our country and an individual who does not accept people for who they are should not be a resprentation of this nation or an influencer to young children.

@ marketbasket tsk tsk, shame on you for letting your managers treat customers in such a disrespectful way. i think @ hannaford, @ walmart, or even @ bjswholesale might prefer my business #shameonyou 
instead of investing elsewhere, why didn't you just pay up for uktv to give your customers what they want & pay for? you can afford to given you've been hiking prices as much as twice a year yet you suggested a £3/month reduction on my package. #disgusted.

somehow this thug, with zero integrity, intelligence or grace is in charge of our great country. not one genuine bone in his body. he insults war heroes & then uses them like marketing props. "vets" "military" "guns" he doesn't even bother with sentences anymore.

by your tweet lack of knowledge or information 
literally sick to my stomach knowing a candidate for #cd2 participated in this event. it appears @ dannydjmorales not only supports kidnapping babies at the border by our govt, he supports "hunting down" migrants as well. ( part of group's list of proposed rules) #disgusted. #az

wtf! how is it even on the books that you can tase a child over 7? since when is a kid running away resisting arrest? it's what kids do! i'm way too angry to even go into what he said to her. i'm so sorry all this happened to you child. #chicagopd #shameonyou … 
i just walked into @ moes_hq and they didn’t say “welcome to moe’s” shameful...truly shameful. 
so completely sick af of the biased and poorly disguised slights towards a sitting president from those jackholes over at @ cbsnews. i know you think the public is stupid, but we totally see through your shit. 
let’s say someone you live with has a crazy wedgie that she ignores and walks around like it’s normal. just yank your shit out, no one needs to see how high/deep your ass crack is 
social media can be good but also bad when the wrong people get on it......smh 
exactly. yet they are easily offended by taking the knee. if that is not hypocritical then i don't know what is... #missingthepoint 
trump, do not rank yourself with president lincoln. he was a man of honesty, intelligence and one who did not believe that slavery should exist or that blacks were not equal to whites. you are certainly not equal to lincoln in any way 
i have generally watched #theview. as a single stay at home mom to a child with disabilities, i found @ wendywilliams entitled in her comments. i want and need to work but who will care for my son in a wheelchair he's 9. 
going through twitter and i can not believe what i am reading, how people can say bad things about @ ddlovato and @ macmiller , even worse people saying it should be her not him, are you kidding me? #sadworld #welivein 
i thought y’all stood for america? since when does this country support one man? don’t we elect a man to serve the people? this is so backwards and crazy and in such plain sight; it’s perfect malevolence. 
such saddens, the folks we elected into office do not have our backs. rather their own agendas of getting as much as they can for themselves and those they deem worthy. we the people should vote them all out! none are worthy! #sickened … 
was walking (daytime), turned the corner, and next to the sidewalk behind a row of cars a worker was peeing! i even uttered something negative. #truestory 
only just seen this thread. i am horrified-this is so damaging. if this is the book i think it is, my local waterstones had a whole window display devoted to it the other week. 
canada should have the death penalty. it would save a lot of time, money and lives! 
i just threw up a little. 
@ cpsenergy wow, no response? thanks. she's now had the inspection done and paid a fee for the release of the permit. i cannot believe you make your customers jump through hoops like this #whatiscustomerservice … 
um. how is it antisocial to be homeless? you know what's fucking antisocial? @ kent_cc fining people for going through a rough time instead of helping them. helping them is your job! not lining your pockets with their dispair! #disgrace #helpthehomeless … 
they don’t give a des. the programme isn’t even “trending” in the uk. #massacreatballymurphy 
actually americans want a scotus that’s honest. he lied 5 times during his confirmation hearing - not sure how you can sweep that under the rug. but we can see your broom. 
he’s an idiot. you forget the hateful minister whose church he went to for years? disavowing that guy doesn’t erase the hatred he continues to carry. dem party is falling apart. hysteria and violence by them is speeding it along. 
#georgezimmerman must think he's so big and bad murdering an unarmed teen and stalking him just because he wore a hoodie and ate skittles. this guy still is an arrogant child who just won't shut up. now he's threatening beyonce and jay-z. he should be in jail. 
completely disgusting and foul. shame on them. … 
@ serenawilliams may have a reputation as someone who can loose her temper. but, what the umpire did to her @the @ usopen was absurd. if she wasn’t a strong black woman, this would never have happened. men do much worse and never get penalized. #doublestandard #tennis 
good, that girl is so tired looking she needs to re evaluate her own situation !! 
so true- the silence is dealing from our “free press” 
so no one’s going to ask brett kavanaugh how he got into massive debt by allegedly buying baseball tickets? this confirmation is a sham. 
exactly, its like black people who work hard towards something just can't win. 
they are showing kids how to make a sandwich on the wiggles and then they do this with the cheese 
#naomiosaka in tears #serenawilliams should be ashamed. 
is that why he wore cops are pigs socks? 
the chair umpire should be banned! disgusted with the abuse of power! #womentreateddifferently 
congrats to osaka because she earned that win for sure, but what happened with serena was definitely awful. 
#serenawillians ruined what should have been a amazing win for #naomiosaka she owes her a apology very unsportsmanlike #disgusted. 
@ usopen by all the prominent foreign advertising on display. it is the #usopen. 
as a lover of the game, i am furious! #usopen2018

good gracious.... wtf @ dallascowboys??!! #nowords #bringbackbailey

if this is true donald j. trump, you've totally betrayed the base that's had your back. have fun hanging out with all the #nevertrumper neocons. and good luck getting them to get out the vote for maga candidates. to the core! 
there's proof of #kavanaugh's perjury in the docs held back by the majority on the committee. we've seen some of the falsehoods in the few that have been released. can you imagine the ratio of lies found if all his docs were made public? the entire process is a sham. 
@ serenawilliams was disgusting today. losing, frustrated, taking over the winner’s happy moments and omg the crowd is just shambolic. well done @ naomi_osaka_ you are here to stay!

of course he does... would you except anything less from the weak minded hate filled swamp? #itscomingdown #betyournervous7thfloor 
we are #disgusted. … 
so after a summer of tweeting racist and sexist "jokes" @ bbcone is giving @ lord_sugar more exposure and another series of the apprentice. just what you pay your licence fee for. #ditchtheapprentice 
yeah! and meanwhile, those of us who are truly struggling through bigger life problems are watching millions easily flow to these yahoos. they couldn’t walk in my shoes for one day! i’m trying to care for my elderly mother! … 
this is one of the most disappointing articles i’ve ever read. it’s one thing for immigrants not to be of concern, but children?! is any of our government a humane one? 
@ twitter needs another indicator (not heart) it should be a head to the head - i can't get over #trump's stupidity and he doesn't even try to be a serious and responsible adult. #nobartoolow #trumptrainwreck 
what the , people! stop assaulting girls and women ! … 
lindsey doesn't think all accused rapists shouldn't be investigated--just the ones that are republican high profile powerful scotus nominees who may have attacked high school girls and need his cover up. 
@ amtrak you should treat customers better who pay to travel with their pets! this is why i fly. why can’t the pet bag stay on my lap? not bothering anyone. do we put children on the floor? he’s an esa not a pet which isn’t even recognized by amtrack. 
@ rtenews gives less than 3 minutes air-time to the #respectandloyaltyparade today for the serving members of @ dfpo poor show of support by the national broadcaster for the plight of the army. state sponsored news at it's best 
and will he be "doing" the irish republicans that backed the spanish & their fascist allies, i think not 
this is what corruption looks like. it doesn't hit you on the head with a club, it slithers up next to you and then pretends to have your best interests at heart. … 
would this questioning go along the same lines as the anita hill hearings because we know how that turned out. 
trump: "very hard for me to imagine anything happened" shouldn't be that hard for you to imagine. you've assaulted/harassed enough women yourself. you know how it works. 
i wonder how many of those upstanding, god fearing men, who will question dr. ford, have undressed a woman without her permission? how many times did any of them brush up against a woman and pretend to be sorry? is a woman only good for their pleasure? 
i'm all for trying to get people to chill, but just remember eric - you have maxine there screaming from the top of her lungs to have her supporters go out and "get" trump fans - so a little hypocrisy-retreat might be due on your part - eh? #corruption #hypocrisy 
how on earth. and yet this... … #enraged #savedietland … 
ikr??!! these beneficiaries of #whitemaleprivilege think the world revolves around them. so far society seems to agree. 
@ gop @ thedemocrats i want to know if kavanaugh is quirky why has he been practicing at the white how to answer questions at the response of the political system in washington #oldwhitepowerfulmen. 
@ aerlingus disgusted by your lack of customer service in dublin airport yesterday. over 2hrs wait to get bags & our buggy for our 1 year old, after a 2 hour flight delay with no explanation or apology. #poorcustomerservice 
i have taught both my daughters and son that this type of feminist bullshit is what keeps us in turmoil rather than helping us all to move forward. this is scary. @ emilylindin try to better our world without creating more hate and division. #alllivesmatter 
for god's sake. what happened to you? from distinguished to disgraceful. that will be your legacy. 
is there no decency? sadly i’m not surprised. … 
my credit score => 800. i applied for @ hsbc_us card with no foreign transact fee. they are being #jerk! i called 3 times in 3 days and provided whatever they asked but every time i was transferred around. today they couldn't find my application. @ hsbc_us #suck n i'm 
you know why, old man. you gop senators are corrupt and pushing this through, after not allowing obama to put a justice replacement in for the last 1-1/2 years! #discrimination an outside investigation is necessary because #kavanaugh is lying, as he did previously! 
i cannot understand how @ wfitzwilliam could ever say to another black girl that she needs to relax her hair. what kind of backwards colonized mind set does she have and what message is she passing on to her son about who is beautiful and what constitutes beauty. 
quick drawing in my response to the kiro drama 
#christinablaseyford #dogandponyshow @ chuckgrassley @ sentedcruz if she can’t testify on monday they it’s her problem! she’s been given all kinds of opportunities. either monday or the vote goes on. no respect for repubs if they keep caving! @ rabbitsjessica 
well you again proved yourself as deceitful. you just implied new startups which hire more woman receive less funding...so now your implying investors ask before investing if they employ women, if so give less funding. please stop ignorantly deceitful propaganda. 
police officer steals the identify of a dead 5 year old so he can infiltrate animal rights groups. how the fuck did he sleep at night. #metpolice … 
i’m betting that amber wasn’t their only victim. #smh 
i'd forgive a jubilee legislature for voting in support of this ridiculous memorandum. but a nasa legislature....ah!! the hand cheque was never about us but your fav politician and his close cronies. but some of you will still shout in their support. can never be me. 
gwa n gpa increase rates almost every 2-4 yrs! gu has 160,000+ pple n ya'll open another bldg in back rd mangilao when the bldg in harmon is fine.. ya'll just need 2 maintain the damn bldg as well as all the other locations instead.. what u guys doing w/ the money? 
...because i didn’t want to be blamed for dressing “seductively”, making up stories, not accepting a “physical compliment”, flirting (when all i’m doing is being cordial), or for some guy losing his job because he wouldn’t keep his hands to himself. #whyididntreport 
few senators expressed such confidence in kavanaugh’s confirmation just days after christine blasey ford went public with her bombshell accusation. … this is what the gop thinks of sexual assault... a hiccup #shameful #truecolors #vote 
damn it! what is happening in this country? trump has been president for less than two years and we’ve already slid so far back that we’re letting sex assault predators go free and are appointing them to the highest court in the land. i’ll be leaving the country now! 
mitch mcconnell says republicans will ‘plow right through’ confirming brett kavanaugh … via @ huffpostpol #kavanaugh gop showing they don't care about sexual assault. hearing is all for show. politics over people. america deserves better! 
@ nandosuk to the mile end nandos. you take over 2 hours to deliver my food, assure me it won’t be cold yet it is. told me there would be sauces and there aren’t. utterly shocking and pathetic. not even apologetic in the slightest. beyond shocking. #nandos 
i don’t understand the obsession my family have with my ex. #im 
by far the most irresponsible, insensitive, uneducated, and ignorant statement. this is why rape culture perpetuates in our society. … 
i’m so mad about the rosenstein story in the @ nytimes wtf are they thinking? are they trying to get him fired? 
this is what susan collins do for a living. she speaks out against anything trump or any sexist gop senator or congressman, then she goes back to the senate & vote with them to push policies that serves her pocket$$$ & theirs. these senators are not for "we the people" 
...this card is not a necessity for me but good to have because it has no foreign transaction fee. i don't like to be denied. i didn't like your business practice. i am #disgusted... 
@ asos @ hermesparcels do you think it's acceptable to deliver someone's parcel in a wheelie bin?!?! because i certainly don't...and i would not call this a "safe place". #asospremier? 
i'm done with people. losing hope there is any sort of sanity out there. honestly glad i don't have children. they excuse bad behavior (but only if they are white, right?) 
this judge needs to be removed from his bench. reading the article make me physical sick to my stomach. … 
@ housegop @ senategop i blame you for the daily dumpster fire in our white house. shame on you! … 
naw, she has to go. lock her ass up for life. 
where’s the proof? shame on you. truly complicit in fake news. who’s paying you? 
@ realdonaldtrump @ flotus @ whitehouse this comment is rich coming from a man who has flaunted his atrocious treatment of women over the years. you don’t know the first thing about respect so please keep your disrespectful musings to yourself. #bebest #manchild 
with all these allegations and "evidence" they are finding against #judgekavanaugh, why are the republicans refusing to expose the facts that we the people are finding about ford? stop being pussies and being afraid of the demonrats! 
here we go, @ virginiahume, i found the clip. you asked “where did people say ‘boys will be boys,’?” how about, “we’re talking about a 17 year old boy in high school. testosterone running high. tell me what boy hasn’t done this in high school”. does that count?! … 
i fail to understand why the judiciary, judges tolerate the display of tortured accused at a hearing before them. at what point do they also ask why the accused has been tortured & call those responsible to court for a hearing. 
you know what grinds my gears? that a billion dollar company, still after 9 years, doesn't have an option in the settings of the game to let the players choose the monitor they want the game to run on. @ riotgames @ leagueoflegends #leagueoflegends #ritoplease 
absolutely spot on. why should i pay my excessive licence fee for this 
they gave him a “pass!” wtf!! how do you kidnap, strangle, assault, and harass someone and get away for it!? #justswitchstates #freeinalaska #smh 
absolutely terrible service just got through on phone and they’ve cancelled my order which i ordered over two hours ago!!!! i had to phone to find this out !!! now have to wait for refund up to 7 days!!!! #yougotmymoney 
mitch mcconnell says republicans will 'plow right through' confirming brett kavanaugh … gop blatantly showing it's true colors. not caring about sexual assault, testimony from victim. #kavanaugh s character includes assault. tha's ok to gop #vote 
chuck grassley all this week........ #feckless 
2-10 is very attainable for this team.... 
nicely done, @ fbi. you can smell #traitortrump's flop sweat from here. only a criminal afraid of being found out would spend so much time insulting and disparaging the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect us. some "potus"... more like a p.o.s. 
bunch of snowbird election fraudsters voting in two states. why isn’t trump admin investigating this type of voter fraud? because it helps him. 
wtf!??? she won't show! it's just another delay tactic. i'm finished! done! i don't want to hear another word about this shi!t! #confirmkavanaughnow #confirmkavanaugh 
this play calling is shit. why put puma in to hand it off? throw the damn ball to one of the te’s 
so, basically, @ chuckgrassley is apologizing to kavanaugh and asking his forgiveness. what a despicable excuse for a human being. #resignnow power has corrupted this man beyond all hope. … 
you’re going down big time. you don’t deserve to reapresent anyone. #votebluetosaveamerica #vote #getoutthevote 
shocking service from @ avivauk @ quotemehappy pushy sales people who passed on details to a 3rd party after clearly stating this was not needed. #badservice #nogdpr 
hate this new fashion trend of wearing training trousers with tops & heels. matlab... why? 
43 years of being @ dallascowboys fan. #disgusted. 
you think you know people... 
@ repgoodlatte c’mon you guys have let the doj dick you around for two years now! subpoena them now. this is a joke. you republicans are so fuqing spineless its unbelievable!!! so spineless! do you think any of us think you idiots have our backs? not in the least. 
25 yrs ago i was shocked when i heard the news of what lorena bobbitt had done to her rapist husband. seeing the gop and their supporters defend one rapist after another i feel like lorena had the right idea #metoo #fightback 
i have no words for what i’m seeing of the @ dallascowboys today. 
@ senfeinstein how do look at yourself in the mirror each morning. you’re a disgrace! you should be investigated for high crimes with your 25 years with a chinese spy and your husband making millions in chinese business deals. now, your involved in this charade! #disgusted! … 
wow. if this is true, i am so beyond livid & embarrassed by the type of “woman” who showed/shows their reckless, hateful, condemnation of a man - damning & smearing him - based on premature emotional biased perceptions and/or to gain on a political agenda. … 
@ ikeauk i am so disappointed in your delivery service. i ordered large items with the understanding that they would be taken to the 'room of choice'. i did this due my partner being 35wks pregnant. why offer a service i really need then say we can't do that? #annoyed 
this is looking really really really bad for the cowboys! #getittogether #dalvssea #dallascowboys 
pppffft!! not enough words for this it sucks!!! when are they going to realise that these animals aren’t an asset or a piece of property they can own!!! they should be in the ocean where they belong free from mankind’s greed! #freemorgan 
@ dallascowboys @ stephenasmith @ maxkellerman @ mollyqerim the cowboys are a dysfunctional mess so far this season...randy gregory doesn’t deserve to rep the star with that penalty 
thanks @ nfl for destroying the game! #nfl #football 
the s*** @ wweromanreigns and @ wwerollins get is so upsetting! all superstars have the right to decline a photograph, or call somebody out for taking a picture without permission! some fans are disrespectful! #disgusted! 
hope you get pregnant if you still can? and then you can publicize that you got an abortion. see how that goes over #votekavanaughnow #abortions #right to … 
just win (first half) baby! @ raiders #smh #grudensucks 
#falcons gonna falcon. always. without fail. #learnhowtotackle 
@ raiders just embarrassed to even mention my favorite nfl team. and #disgusting 
@ lindseygrahamsc @ senatemajldr @ chuckgrassley do you have children? #whatifithappenedtothem 
they should bow their head in shame after what they did to this nice man. #kavanaughconfirmation i for one would like dr ford to release her psychiatric records. 
thank you! i can’t understand some people! 
i really, really hate the democrat party but i do not hate the people who belong to this gross party. please join our american movement democrats. only the leaders who are pathetic and unethical. look what they are doing to our country. #walkawayfromdemocrats 
i may not be the nicest person around, i never pretended to be, but my intent is never to bully someone off of twitter because of an opinion. you are one sad individual and believes that's acceptable behavior then you seriously need to seek help 
warning. this may be very sensitive to some viewers but, watch anyway and maybe it will wake your sensitive ass up … 
geography isn't economy though. yeah and actually it's a bunch of islands which all may decide to go independent one day, taking the sea with them?! i just find it funny, how much we want independence but deny it to african and other nations via conflict economy tools. 
should not have caved on monday hearing & been holding confirmation vote thursday. you dunderheads are the majority, remember? 
you lie! you lie! you lie! you knew about all of it - all of it. 
you all should be fired!!! you stopped representing americans and america a very long time ago. go get a job like “real” “hard working” americans. and make crumbs like the rest of us deplorables. 
i do hope majority of americans boycott @ nytimes we can show them what a #bluetsunami is! @ nytimes has given #trumpt cover 2fire #rosenstein by all accounts! 
repubs are like toothless babies getting eaten by swamp alligators. the political majority letting the other side bully them. 
@ skysports @ skyuk 3 channels all showing the same program?you are a can you charge for that? 
timeline: 1)bk confirmed thursday 2) rosenstein fired friday 3) russia investigation closed down monday 4) roe overturned before june next year this all could have been prevented if congress did their job. 
thanks, but no thanks. a string of my cheez-its. @ cheezit @ 
the republican are the majority but clearly it's the democrats that are the dominant political caste in this country. does it even matter if republicans take seats in the mid-term when they're political eunuchs? vote red anyway as cowards do better in numbers. 
i just viewed this and sadly white males are showing just how despicable they are. i must change race and gender. i'm ashamed. and yes this shit is what women ensure every damn day. i see it constantly. men this is so ugly. quit thinking with your little head!!! #metoo … 
what's the standard for the #gop allowing the dems to ruin one man's life based on decades of allegations that never surfaced during his 6 previous vetting process? let's not forget the threats made to his family as well. #justsaying #onevoiceonevote 
this is #awful and so, so #wrong. … 
republicans have announced their plans to go ahead with their sc vote on friday. no time to process dr ford’s testimony the day before. this is one big fucking shit show. #disgraceful #fedup 
unbelievable. what a bunch of shickens***s these @ gop senators are... can't even ask their own questions. call me … 
anyone who has said that you'll like the film #thehousewithaclockinitswalls if you like harry potter has obviously been drinking too much. that poor excuse of a film was nothing like harry potter. #harrypotter 
doesn’t make sense to put cosby in jail and kavanaugh in the supreme court. america at its finest. 
now all they need to do is get their thumbs out of their asses & vote. 
does this mean that democrats will be in charge at the hearing? since the majority party senators are abdicating their responsibilities? why should u, an elected senator, defer to a non elected individual? and why should dr. ford answer to this person in the 1st place? 
police officers lives = 3 years in prison! #feelsick … 
humiliated by a waitress today at plakamoto restaurant in nessebar who abrutly told me to keep my tired baby quiet as other customers were trying to eat. we were quickly handed our bill #wtf #nodesserts 
when the person that you actually wanna talk to won’t respond 
embarrassing...they don’t represent us. this is what we’re brainwashing in their heads in college of law...no due process needed? forget our rules of law; our constitution. #comfirmkavanaugh #westandwithtruth 
the blonde lady shot down the idea of a pain awareness campaign. she said it would interfere with the mandate to decrease prescribing and would "compete with the current messaging warning how #addictive #opioids are". there it is. we are completely expendable. 
i am so enraged and sickened to be constantly reminded by a man that a woman is just not important. any woman, any circumstance, that a man will decide what is or is not valid, what is or is not my decision, what is or is not my trauma. 
if @ senfeinstein 's under- handed tactics work in derailing the time honored process in which we vet those appointed for scotus, i look forward to more 11th hour unsubstantiated garbage thrown at nominees demanding fbi investigations & more time. 
my last few months as a blue tbh 
whatever happens to bill cosby is sad because he was a monster the whole time..i loved him just like many of you,but he was a disgusting monster praying upon women 
so disgusted with our elected officials. #wakeupamerica #gopcorruption #votenoonkavanaugh 
shame on you @ esuwarriors this is my son’s jersey on another player! he is out on a medical redshirt! 
but she's regarded as an assistant to the #gop. shows what they truly think. 
thanks for watching i cannot stand watching #liarinchief he is revolting. i’m so embarrassed to be a citizen of a country that elected a liar, cheater, misogynist and sexual predator to the highest office 
wow! @ gop should be ashamed @ yale shouldn't be such puppets. #disgusting #disgustinggop … 
so... i know ain't nan one of these niggas gon burn they nikes, just like they ain't stop watching football, but i ask you, how many times we gon let them spit in our faces? … 
because it fits their ‘victim’ narrative. why would a ‘victim’ hire a #pornstar’s shyster? @ michaelavenatti 
i’m disgusted. or should i say, #disgusted. you hired a woman to do the questioning, so that republicans didn’t commit political suicide—with an identical picture of the anita hill trial. 
@ realdeancain if anyone has ever paid attention to my twitter i probably have plenty of reason to hate males. but that would be wrong & unjust. i'm not sure what this war is with everyone who has a penis is stemming from but the lies from the left needs to stop! 
mr. kurd? he didn’t really say that, right? must be fake news? #trump #sitdown 
watching trump speak at his press conference. sitting on my hands so i don’t throw a bowl of pistachio nut shells at the screen. every u.s. president who served before him must have his face in his hands. #trump #sitdown 
potus you are guilty! guilty of not putting the american people first. guilty of your campaign dealing w russia. guilty of bringing the swamp to dc. guilty of cheating on your wife! guilty of dividing the usa #resignnow #impeachtrump #fedup 
come on @ chickfila why my cheese and pickle look like this? not 
@ curryspcworld i have never known such terrible customer service. you’re happy to take £2000 from me but when it comes to after care you couldn’t care less about your customer. 
grassley didn't fall into the delay trap; he jumped in feet first. if they fail to confirm bk, it will expose how weak republican majority really is. then they can kiss midterms goodbye. 
cool. til bro pull up at your sister house for netflix and chill... with the same mentality … 
rt @ geowashaxe: we need to end @ thedemocrats once and for all i am ! thank #god for this guy ! #the_return_of_lindsey he's #un_rino'd himself! dean @ geowashaxe 
i'm a glutton for punishment. after watching the entirety of the #kavanaughhearings i've switched over to fox news. the are absolutely giddy about the testimony today, playing #kavanagh's snidest soundbites, and talking about how great he'll look on the bench. 
...and spartacus bragged about it. #disgusted! @ … 
absolutely. not to mention that no one is questioning mark judge. i'm sure the fbi would question him. can't wait to hear that guy plead the 5th. 
@ lindseygrahamsc i really think that your "good friend" #johnmccain would be quite disappointed w/ you of late. #sosad 
this is a #disgrace! be ashamed of yourself #usa be very ashamed. the next time you chant usa, remember what you really stand for. frustrated trump turns optimistic on kavanaugh … 
@ starwars @ disney fire @rachelabutera she did not “make a mistake.” she purposefully mocked dr. blasey-ford. intent is not a mistake. 
who decided it was a good idea to invoke tears by talking about his ten year old daughter as a defense to his dawg days? 
watched the #kavanaughhearings so i can be just as depressed the day after his confirmation, as i was the morning after elections day... #ibelievechristineblaseyford #stopkavanaugh 
too true and well said. #ashamed … 
watching the good ol’ boy system at work is a slap in the face. feels like any progress made in the last 50 years has just been erased right in front of our eyes. 
very suspicious - it makes no sense. how would that child turn up dead if he wasn’t murdered - he couldn’t of died from dehydration or starvation, so what happened? he wasn’t at that park. his body was probably moved & placed strategically 
@ therac spoken to 5 different people and still can’t tell us when anyone can come - first told we are priority as on a busy motor way - please help us we are frozen been here on road side waiting 3 hours 20 minutes !!! 
kavanaugh seemed to want to put his hand over their mouths @ brettkavanaugh @ gop @ lindseygrahamsc @ tedcruz 
i was floored that he disrespected both feinstein & leahy...this “christian” would speak to his elders in this fashion?!? 
i am absolutely with how the left behaved today. the epitome of #hypocrisy! #smdh #confimkavanaughnow 
@ lesliesmith_gf i support your cause and am utterly appalled by the decision made by the nlrb. every single other sport has some sort of union. what the hell is going thru your mind @ danawhite ! 
does anyone else feel like no one knows how to behave like a rational adult anymore?? #disappointed #sad 
this is flipping out of control @ realdonaldtrump @ potus #confimkavanaughnow #enoughisenough we the people demand this circus end!! … 
this is wrong on all accounts. for goodness sake, this is shameful behaviour from female members of staff toward a female pupil. where is their empathy and willingness to help? and what of the pastoral care at this school? is there any? 
just blocked some twat that claims to be a victim of sexual violence yet wonders how many more “victims” will come out of the woodwork. her quotes not mine. 
i don't think i did either, but it is happening fast, and very real!! this is absolute madness happening right now. 
@ jeffflake you coward. you got all self-righteous on the senate floor and it was obviously just a performance. hope you’re feeling really good about your decision to totally contradict yourself with your yes vote. 
can you believe those fake tears? you could even see him building himself up to cry. i was 
goodbye, america. hello, handmaid’s tale. 
well the republicans turned into disgusting cowards and flake a traitor...wonder if the letter from that democrat senator to fords lawyer fake evidence to set up kavanaugh to prove fords story.... 
head explodes. democrats are never going to vote (or even be civil) for republicans. and flake is channeling mccain with an f-you to trump, who cares about wrecking a man’s life or the advise and consent process. #confimkavanaughnow 
what is wrong with you, @ tomperez? this weakness is how we lose votes. … 
very disappointed @ jeffflake allowed democrats to continue this charade against an innocent man. democrats never ever give the republican the benefit of the doubt and they never will. they are scam artists and sen. flake just added a week of misery to the kavanaughs! … 
so agree!!!! formal dem now independent voting republican!!! changing our fundamental law until it applies to them! grrrr!!!!! 
think ama stay inside since there so much proud battyman walking the road 
if it were an investigation and that is it you are right but we know they will delay, a new charge from an anonymous source will come up or they feel like there was not enough time or something else and you will let it happen 
i look forward to a follow up interview! i'm all in. #kavanaughhearings 
@ senjudiciary @ gop @ senategop @ jeffflake dr fords lawyers are demanding this not be limited in size or scope. which is exactly what i knew would happen. congratulations. democrat minority riding rough shot right over you and you are letting it happen. 
absolutely #disgusted, i almost swallowed that thing!! @ kopparberguk never again! 
@ geraldorivera you are a liberal trying to act like an independent. please don't ever come back to @ thefive. and, please don't mention how you are such good friends with @ realdonaldtrump. seriously dude, you need to retire. #focus 
so as a temporary fix until we get our new bed, hubby bought a yawn airbed from @ littlewoods, just opened it and we have been sent a used one! absolutely gutted as this is the second one, the first was faulty. 
wouldn’t want to get all the facts out there, would we. … 
did i really see falcon slander on ig with my own two eyes. i am 
and the treatment of @ keithellison's domestic violence victims has no bearing on why women don't come forward either. he was rewarded with becoming the deputy chair of your party. besides being a hypocrite, you're sickening. with your whole party. 
what i find most disturbing about this #kavanaugh fiasco is repeated phrases like "no credible evidence". because the testimony of an assault survivor (or four of em) isn't "enough" so remember! if you're going to get raped, make sure you get some video of it. 
annnd..you knew it was coming jfc! rwnjs can't possibly think anyone's sincere, motivated by truth & justice why is that? could it be that they're never motivated by truth & justice? demanding it is "manipulation" "harassment" … 
.⁦ @ maziehirono⁩ is obvious in this being all politics. she doesn’t care about women, or real victims. … 
anyone know why we even bothered to go down to munster ...total annihilation !! .. 
i woke up w/ throw up in my hair af 
judge cavanaugh gave a heartfelt painful almost tearful statement to the committee and all you see is someone acting badly. one only hopes that a member of your own family is similarly accused and met with the same type of derision as you afforded this honorable man … 
@ barbrastreisand i was thrilled to see you shouting out for @ realtimers bill maher before his broadcast last night. then i watched him pussyfoot with bannon and felt the need to ask what you thought about bill's decision to give him a platform & then truckle a monster. 
it's not human. 
@ jeffflake this is what they do to a family while you agree to coddle n play nice w/demsocialists #boybye #dontletthedoorknobhitya … 
buying stuff and keep asking for free stuff and not using or needing them. trying to fill up the void inside their heart with stuff. they will never be satisfied and will keep getting stuff. i am so disgusted. #suffocatedwithstuff #consumerism 
time to #boycott @ hbo... fine line between freedom of speech and utter disrespect. ... rip john mccain. bill maher attacks lindsey graham for defending kavanaugh, says senator needs 'his dead boyfriend' john mccain. … 
so, now extra marital affairs are no more illegal?? marriage has definitely lost its sanctity..!! 
nope- democrats and decent is an oxymoron! #idiotdemocrats 
hollywood cares not about #metoo. it's more important to bash republicans. sexual assault be damned. #mattdamon thinks grabbing butts is okay and our country being in a frenzy over sexual assault charges is a joke. #walkawayfromdems march is oct. 26-28

this person that calls himself "the president" is standing at a podium surrounded by people saying "republicans did this" "republicans did that" "republicans care about you". this has got to be the most non bipartisan speech i have ever heard. #notmypresident 
what about lying? you ok with that too? 
this invective irreparably damages britain and is the most disgusting comment since boris’ attacks on moslems.

welcome to our world! it has always been a scary time for girls and women - what with verbal, physical, emotional abuse and sexual assaults and rape - it is a scary world out there as boys and men are not taught to value and respect us. 
this broke my heart. how can you not have the common decency and humanity to treat one another as brother and sister? instead of giving him a hot cup of coffee and a donut- you decide the better option option was to pour water over him? …

grooming gangs had been active for 10yrs before tommy robinson was even heard of. what excuse was she using throughout that first decade of the grooming gangs? and now she has the audacity to through slurs at those who do speak up.

sick people!!!! 
i am sick to death of schmuck shroomer and his 3 ring circus. his democrat clowns have turned the senate process into the laughing stock of the nation. if he wants to redeem himself, he needs to vote for kavanaugh and shut up until midterms. 
these fucking men can’t keep their damn hands to themselves. 
she harnessed enormous courage to speak up and did w/dignity. she doesn't deserve to be demeaned by the pres. . @ senatorcollins 
sarah sanders should be ashamed for defending #potus's mocking of dr. ford. sarah can no longer be considered a female. she's either a robot or an alien. her neck needs to be checked for a zipper to determine which one. #shameful #ibelievedrchristineblaseyford

no way. you guys should be ashamed of what you have done to this family. 
i agree with @ lindseygrahamsc tell it like it is!! #lindseygraham #confirmjudgekavanaughnow #votenow …

decades of work for victim's rights were were pushed back in a matter of a week because our elected leaders and their followers want to secure a spot on the highest court to take away freedom of speech and to make sure you get your guns!

oh, that's what that was. #disgusted. 
why is everyone outraged over @ senatorcollins? i blame @ sen_joemanchin for this #voteno 
@ sen_joemanchin you have betrayed your fellow democrats for what is clearly your own political motives. hope you lose your seat. 
when @ democrats take cntrl of both houses, @ nancypelosi & @ senschumer should resign leadership positions. reasons? 1) they can't #lead! 2) @ joemanchinwv #kavanaughvote today & inability to keep party alignment. 3) other partisan/leadership fails & weakness. #ashamed 
there is no justice. even if you take the sexual assault out, that man does not have the character or temperament to sit on the scotus! this, senator collins, should have been enough for you to exclude him as an option. shame on you! 
she should be ashamed of herself, she has betrayed us all. 
what makes this even more troubling, he works out less than 10 blocks from a womens shelter that has 100 women at any given time. yeah, that part. …

regardless of whether he did or did not assault someone the aggressive belligerent hysterical way he behaved at the hearing proved he was not fit for senior office. 
beyond belief! senate votes to confirm brett kavanaugh to the supreme court … 
beyond words! senate confirms kavanaugh to supreme court, ending a clash with lasting fallout

this is why slave states fought for the electoral college system by the way....just this kind of crap. … 
#outraged the constitutional remedy is impeachment. the house has impeached 15 judges, one on the supreme court. now demand that the house provide what hasn’t yet happened — a full investigation of kavanaugh’s record including perjury. 
and yet..... we fans have to witness this franchise settle below mediocrity! 
maybe get back the second rounder they lost in the @ 52mack_ trade ! #anotherwastedyear #thanksmarkandchuckie 
"the one silver lining that i hope will come from this is that more women will press charges now, when they are assaulted," oh no you do not. you do not give a f*ck about assaulted women. you are a liar and a hypocrite of the first order. 
this from the man who mocks a sexual assault survivor? you are so outside the norm of american values, you are the fringe. i am appalled at your lack of decency and commonplace manners. 
you’re too old to be acting like this. #growup #shameful 
and how. these bozos are a disgrace to the people of this country. they make a mockery of government. not by the people. no its government by these old white men hell bent on trying to take the country back to 1950. the sooner they are gone the better america will be. …

what this does is encourage malicious gossip . any1 can say anything abt a person if they don’t like his face, if he’s yelled at them, if he didn’t give them work..the permutations r endless. yes there are men who harass women with impunity.this guy isn’t 1 of them. 
every time i think it couldn’t get any worse, it does. #nokavanaugh #notmypresident

i am so disgusted that they are a bunch of black men and women at the trump wh being used for a photo op and prop. who are these people? how can they allow themselves to be used in this manner? #howcouldyou #votethemoutnov6th 
how many times while @ kristenpowers was on @ foxnews did we hear her say everyone’s opinions mattered & she told everyone she accepted god & became a christian... & she’s a pundit telling everyone her feelings....what a #hypocrite... … 
this is what he considers coming together - complaining that 12 assassination attempts are being covered & taking attention away from politics. … 
joke of an apology! only did it cos he was caught doing it & it went viral... 
duty. my.ass. he's going to get his fix 
good god @ gop are you really just as debase and disgusting as pos @ potus ? disgusting … 
@ forever21 got rid of their plus size section why bother with an online version? 
avenatti should be ashamed and embarrassed for his own client and himself because she is a "porn star" and he is a "porn lawyer" who represents her. he lost his deferomatin case against trump n she has to pay trumps legal fees, women deserve real representation. 
@ tuiukcares @ tuiuk @ holidaytui thieves under investigation! tui stealing money and time from hard working customers with their lies #dontgiveupthefight for what you dreamed of and what you paid for! with their tactics to drain people after ribbing them! 
completely fed up with and by @ oxgordauto bad representation of their items, inept customer service staff, intentional misleads. i hope their entire company goes bankrupt 
what the f*** is wrong with this generation...people cheating on their significant others like it’s nothing...if you’re in a relationship, commit yourself completely to that person. if you can’t commit, don’t be in a relationship. 
i can’t believe a human being, and ashamedly a swfc fan has actually had the audacity to think this was acceptable! think the police should take up this one 
every single media outlet should shut him down, do not show any of his maga rallies. it always about him, he could not give one shit about anybody but himself. it doesn't enter his mind to speak with empathy about people murdered today, unless it is written for him. 
@ billysharp10 on behalf of every other swfc fan, we apologise for an idiots comments made earlier on twitter. football is a game why people make it personal is just unacceptable! #sorry 
imagine thinking and wishing this on such a talented successful innocent black woman. #thisisreality #shame 
uhh, not jews. judaism. how dare you assume their race based on their place of religious worship. 
@ easyjet i have never been more appalled with a company for their complete lack of customer service. my flight was cancelled in july and i was promised a refund for the hotel bill i incured. 3 months, 4 hours on hold and still nothing. 
#flyers i’m done with you until the coaching staff is all replaced. plenty of other teams to watch who want to play for their coach. #nhlcenterice 
how can anybody respect this whackjob? feel dirty listening to him. who could possibly be less sincere? 
apparently we are killing jews again. @ realdonaldtrump. 
. @ christopherhahn should be ashamed and embarrassed for attacking my client and i because she is a "porn star" and i am a "porn lawyer" who represents her. he perpetuates the myth that certain women do not deserve to be treated with respect or have representation. 
i just can't tolerate him any more. i'm rarely on twitter now, i switch channels when he's speaking or walk out of the room. he is twitter trump - teleprompter trump is a fraud. i voted. that's all i can do right now. 
hope he gets released. …

had a terrible sleep. i dreamt that our @ dodgers manager, dave roberts, took out #richhill with a 1-hitter going? he put in #madson who had already allowed 5 inherited runs to score over the 1st 3 games. then i woke up 30 minutes ago & realized it wasn’t a dream! 
trump revives ‘enemy’ label against media after synagogue attack …

what is the @ deptofdefense going to do when t. orders them to fire on the women and children that will be near the border in 2 months? …

@ drivevauxhall hope the money was worth it!! vile act in the face of heartbreak and tragedy for so many! #scum …

this is extremely sad for both #vickiejones and #mauricestallard's family and friends, for his grandson who witnessed such violent hatred and for this country!!! the fact that decent people have to share air with degenerate racists makes me sick and to my core!!! … 
@ carpetright disgusted at treatment your #newtownabbey branch gave a single mother. removed a door to fit carpet. didn’t tidy up or replace door when store was questioned they responded that “most people would be happy” not only have you lost my custom but many others 
our 'priest' was a pedophile (he's dead now) ... then the other 'priest' was a gambler who siphoned off the coffers..he was charged and convicted..now he's in a guelph church collecting duis ... it's all there!! xcatholic !! 
£1 bn for defence this year but only £650m for social care in 2019-20. clearly killing people is more important than caring for them. #budget2018 
wow just yesterday @ cbcalerts was pushing propaganda that this was going to be great for canadian investments. hope whoever wrote that piece of crap is fired. right wing hate is never okay, even when it comes to possibly making a buck.

@ drivevauxhall why would you let your leicester branch sell cctv footage of our chairman’s helicopter tragedy? that is not a way to make money!!

if a college educated person who has been in the political spotlight for more than a decade can slip and say something like this - who knows what else she's thought. is there no hope for equality and acceptance in this country? … 
uh, don’t care at all. #gobacktony #exhaustedbythem … 
this is bogus. i blame the liberal media and the democrat party starting with @ senfeinstein for making this type of false claim the new norm in our society. i do not condone this type of political hit job which is a slap in the face to real women who have suffered. …

seriously? a message from the loto to a child seemed like just the right thread to jump on with your thing? you need to get some perspective, and grow up.

@ scientology is by far the most despicable “religion” more so, cult to exist. #godspeedforthethousandsofpeopletrapt #cantshakethisoneoff #inhumane 
ours was spend £137 each week to get £32. i threw it in the bin 
@ verynetwork 2/2 i have since spoken to customer services who stated that you allow say 200 people to order a product that you have 100 of and send replacements to the other 100 at £100 cheaper that's £10k overcharged that vulnerable customers may not notice #ripoff 
i watched that press conference and your ‘video’ has obviously been edited and your little statement is a bold-faced lie. how do you sleep at night?! #timetoresign, #youarealiar 
watch & see there wont b anyone question the results where all these demoncrats won( theres no way) we're being lied to folks -patriots #rigged" & they stole seats all over america @ realdonaldtrump @ donaldjtrumpjr @ loudobbs @ seanhannity @ marklevinshow #lies 
@ ikeausa @ xpologistics are felons! make sure to google “theft” and “forgery” #theft #forgery 
holding truth to power to a potus who consistently lies is being rude? please. people are sick of it. btw notice how the spreader of hate and fear is no longer tweeting abt the caravan since the election? hmmmm could it have been a political ploy after all? 
thanks @ xpologistics for stealing our furniture and forging our signature. @ ikeausa why do you keep doing business with them?! 
one of former attorney general jeff sessions' final acts was to make it nearly impossible for federal civil rights lawyers to rein in police abuse. … via @ huffpostpol #trumpswamp part of problem. no solutions. #shameful #sessions 
the democrat party is far too corrupt. you are always cheating!!! 
@ gliderbelfast @ translinkmetro please get a message out to drivers: when bus lanes are flooded, please don't speed through them & soak me & an elderly person from head to toe (& i mean a river not a splash!). while waiting 40mins on a bus today, this happened 7 times! 
he is such a child. why can’t he just shut up and focus on real issues. bullies always want the last word. - trump pushes back at michelle obama - cnn politics … 
#matthewguy #kendoll wants the perks of power without any responsibility #springst 
of course, @ senatemajldr is a @ realdonaldtrump sycophant first american second #gopcorruption 
that is bad parenting and not at all what grassroots footie is all about. 
election-reporting rules are being violated hourly. after 3 days, county officials can't give us a straight answer to a pointed question about what the hell is going on. but who cares, right? 
jeffrey, with such mean intent it surprises no one that you favor trump. how can you say that to another human being????? 
@ realdonaldtrump your ability to lead is disgraceful. the most populous state is under a state of emergency and you’re tweeting to save yourself. california does not support you. 
the irony of trump’s administration being outraged that “he put hands on a woman” but not outraged their leader sexually assaults on the reg. … 
he is such a miserable excuse for a human being. congress, where are you? every member of the @ gop who remains quiet needs to be out of a job when their term is up. … 
my gosh, these bishops are powerless, mute, and weak. where is leadership? time to pass authority mantle. they are hiding, terrified,behind skirts of political power, hoping not to get noticed, and making selves fools in the process. need a st paul to jar them awake. 
he a disgusting liar and his disgusting followers believe his disgusting lies. guess what i am. you got it in one - disgusted! #liarinchief 
why is olly murs always in his underwear 
@ potus @ thejusticedept law enforcement & those in government need to stand up for our communities & put a stop to these attacks. this behavior shouldn't be tolerated! this vehicle belongs to the taxpayers. we paid for it. enough is enough! #onevoiceonevote 
1/2 - 3 days ago i saw this uncapped syringe at ala moana center. i told an hpd officer who was sitting right there. fiddling w her phone- she obviously wasn’t concerned b/c it was still there today! so i called @ chowproject & found out how to safely get rid of 
omg!!! i just stumbled on to the @ foxnews channel and i’m just how #chauvinistic you are having a show called “ #outnumbered” because it’s 4 female panelists and 1 male panelist. your network’s constant demonization and dehumanizing view of women is very apparent. 
so what? snipes has already been convicted of destroying ballots in the last national election! she stays in the same job, and neither the state nor feds monitored that election from the inside! she'll get fined, and soros will give her 10 times whatever she's fined. … 
as a maricopa resident, i am@ at this #disgraceful #incompetence where is @ … 
of course kentucky loses to georgia and feels like they have nothing to play for anymore. 
i’m so disgusted!! millions of people fought the bloodiest of wars in the very harshest of conditions, and donald trump cancelled a visit to a cemetery where he was representing his country due to weather. you should be ashamed mr trump! 
this is clearly damage control from your staff writers ... too late. you’ve shown your true colors time and time again. #embarrassing 
utterly disgusting. what an absolute disgrace from trump … 
@ victoriassecret and i love the fact how you only mentioned the transgendered comments but never apologized and the plus sized comments. #victoriassecret #plussizemodels 
he's disgusted? but he hasn't been disgusted by trump before . . . not even with all of the disgusting things trump has been doing . . . all while kelly sits by his side, even voices his support on occasion? but now he's disgusted? give me a fucking break. 
my daughter too and she went to d.c. after inauguration day despite the fact that she has infertility problems. does my daughter not understand those women marching approve killing babies? 
why do we have laws if there are no consequences once they are broken or disobeyed? the main issue with any government official is there is no accountability. if your average voter ignores a court order they'll be escorted to the nearest jail cell. #accountability 
how does any “patriotic” veteran still support this president when he has essentially flipped the bird to those that have paid the ultimate price defending our freedom because of a little rain #pathetic 
nails teeshirts to supreme court door until the capital cops drag me away to whatever dark hole they put the real psycho cases in assuming they don't just shoot and apologize later? #disgusted.metallurgist.done!# 
you’re to optimistic spartan avenue. we might not be some awful team but we’ll never get back to big time bowls just 8-9 wins on a good year. completely embarrassing performance from our offense today and i’ve about had it with mark dantonios stubbornness and pride. 
@ marksandspencer bought fish pie didn’t expect a whale bone in it 
absolutely no reason south carolina didn’t walk away with this game. conservative calls and three and outs on extremely easy to read hand offs up the gut. 
if you thinking of having a medical device implant think again and look at all fda recalls and criminal charges against the manufacture. #medtronics #recalls #harmful 
that made a mockery of dance #scd #scd2018 
i can’t watch trump in any video... his mere presence and voice makes me disgusted. i’ve never had this behavior towards anyone. but he is a cruel, rude, dishonest, hypocritical, fascist, sexist, racist... etc. even him, i must learn to love. it’s f***** hard. 
no. we didn’t do anything when children were the victims. why would this be different when some politicians’ first instinct is to ask how we’ll protect the 2nd amendment in the wake of the tragedy. 
@ coachgusmalzahn should have been let go after the tn. game. #forthegoodofau 
so because your ex moved on, you murdered her and then kill yourself in front of your child? why are men so weak and heartless? now this child has to grow up without her parents. steups 
the things being done to @ tuckercarlson’s family are absolutely inexcusable. more insanity on the left in an attempt to bend a very proud country to it’s will w/ cheating, lying, and violence. someone will start pushing back soon and our patience is waining. 
i hate them frienddddd omg i didnt even tell u wat happened 
can we either assassinate or impeach him already? #potus what an #idiotinchief i'm embarrassed to call myself an american.

thanks @ panerabread i am very upset with my order today. ordered a broccoli cheddar soup and 2 turkey chili bowls and they were all watered down. that’s not soup or chili. please do something about this. i expect better. 
@ ocasio2018 how can you let this happen? you need money for an apartment???? how about the homeless students at my school???? … 
i know @ forceindiaf1 won't give a toss but i've unfollowed them due to otmar szafnauer's comments! 
well thank you @ forceindiaf1 ocon destroyed @ max33verstappen win and otmar defended him. 
@ scottforflorida has no one to blame but himself. the dems play to win...the reps do not. the reps have done nothing these past few years to protect and enforce #constitution #equaljustice they just turn the other cheek 
@ devinwenig how dare ebay restrict my account because i have a friend who has an unpaid bill of yours, and you somehow made the huge leap by connecting my account worth with hers. i've been an ebay user for over 15 years, & am now unable to use it. i should sue you. 
you might want to check if your curriculum teaches history, civics & sociology. also check if your mission statement embraces diversity. something is amiss; the boys' behavior is a symptom of a larger culture that that permits white male supremacy. #disgraceful 
it's because president trump and the republicans are just sitting back letting it happen! i've decided they're all spineless! 
so shook when i saw the tv listing. who the hell puts an awards show on rerun status. apparently the “geniuses” @ e_entertainment @ e_tv_pr do. had they given #theroyals a final season they could have been heroes! but no let’s continue the path to mediocrity. #itsjustsad 
@ northernassist @ northernfail i think i now have the whole set.... leaves on the line, frozen points, track too hot and now tonight slippery rails! what an absolute joy to have to use your services! #disgrace 
and the republicans and the president aren't doing anything about it. they might as well resign and let the democrats take over! it's going to happen anyway! 
the spineless republicans are just sitting back letting it happen. they might as well resign and let the democrat's take over! 
laura, it sickens me to see you working so hard to try to fix everything, when the president and the spineless republicans just sit back and let it happen! they should all just resign and let the democrats take control. it's going to happen anyway! 
what difference does it make? you and the spineless republicans are just sitting there letting it happen! you all might as well resign and let the democrats take over! it's only a matter of time before they do anyway! 
after all these years @ novartiscancer & rest of drug & medical industries should be 100% sure of either prevention or cure for various cancers. by medically-relayed profits gutting/killing consumers/patients … 
when will the republicans finally have enough of the democratic corruption? @ potus and the rest of the republicans should just resign now, and let the democrats take over! it's going to happen anyway. it's disgusting to watch these spineless republicans bow down! 
why take it back when the taliban is on your side? 
here i am, days later and @ fedex still has done absolutely nothing to get my package. same info today that i got last wed. no change, no calls no package. #pathetic #incompetent

this is what hollywood funds @ gerardbutler #zionist #inhumane … 
seriously, this guy is our president? who voted for this guy? shameful, all around. #embarassed @ gop 
surely callanan will have to lose his title & pension and tusla need to have a good look at themselves. allegations of child abuse is not a copy & paste case, a man's reputation is at stake. #disgusted@callanan #whistleblower 
magic weekend at anfield what a load of shite @ therfl #shocking 
there is a way to have election integrity. us is most technologically advanced in the world. they just don’t want to fix it. both sides are despicable. politics is such a dirty game and citizens are basically ignored. …

a customer from the start with #esatdigifone then onto #o2 and now onto @ threeireland for a continuous 21 years since its inception, i always thought customer loyalty was a prized asset. apparently not - the treatment is exactly the same as if you signed up last week 
i honestly thought at end... it was going to say “she should be able to choose being girl/boy...” i just got punched in the gut by this. #horrific #sick #liberals 
the kid in the front row making the white power sign.. we see you!! #thoughtyouwerebeingslick 
please no ... 
it surprises me considering our horrid treatment of the slaves and african americans in the south, that senators can still be flippant about using the term hanging in public conversation. 
hey @ malibusafaris you are disgusting! you left your beauitiful animals behind and were all burned alive while they were trapped in tbeir cages!! you are sociopaths! omg! giraffes, etc. you could have contacted the shelters that were housing animals or the zoo! 
why do we even have election laws if they will not be followed? most of the counties have already certified. now this judge gives till friday 5pm extension and most provisional votes r massive dems? … 
have you been to #frace lately? if not do go and talk to the french about what they think of this guy. #disappointment #norfittolead. 
exactly @ michaelavenatti...your actions leave me … 
everything about this video is absolutely disgusting! the girl’s behavior, of course. but also that there is no one there to stop it. no teachers, and no fellow students who will have the courage to stand up and do something. everyone just sits back and watches. 
@ nick_clegg no comment from you of course, you pathetic excuse for a human...and i actually voted lib dem in every election (local, national & european) until 2014. call me a troll but it's true...but never again. … 
#notoryconfidence #brexit 
recent day at #cadmv reinforced the horrendous lack of #leadership at this moribund agency. surly employees are direct reflection of dysfunctional #organizationalculture created by their managers. that said, we citizens deserve much, much better. 
you don’t provide on the president - perhaps checks and balances will they may be fed up with @ realdonaldtrump we are fed up with you for not honoring your oath of office! #ruleoflaw #wakeupamerica 
you serious. we are playing by the rules, while our enemies are not. @ repmcsally cucked on us, everyone needs to see that the @ gop cares more about their political careers than going to the mat for our country! if she runs for school board, we need to primary her. 
“brexit means brexit” you said. “no deal is better than a bad deal” you said. you have capitulated at every turn, now it seems a bad deal is better than no deal. #getmayout #brexitbetrayal 
are the votes public? can we find out who voted for it against? #usccb18 
@ repmcsally @ marthamcsally quit fighting the illegally gotten signatures in these democratic strongholds because she knows she will be ‘anointed’ to the senate in 2 years! she didn’t fight for our legal votes in az! and i donated to her campaign- will never again now! 
the @ gop will never learn. calling this guy a powerhouse when we just had an election and he was surprisingly absent in pushing the @ housegop agenda to keep the house. @ jim_jordan did far more to promot our @ potus agenda and this swamp creature pulled a paul ryan. 
@ redplumsaves retail me not everyday is the worst environmentally wasteful company i have ever seen. i have requested to be opted out of their mailing list and they just send more. if i’m just one person, how much paper are you sending out for people to trash? #recycle
