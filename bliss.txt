they're no "goodbyes" in #heaven... #aforeverrealm 
same i'm jet-blueing on the way back. but i must say besides the $40 wifi fee this virgin experience has been #bliss. i have a food tab on my screen and just keep ordering snax without having to close the movie. 
i'm doing these twilight nights to recall my fandom days & to never forget all the memories i have from that time.. the films, the books, the soundtracks, the shared love, the friends i made, the long nights of no sleep and staying awake for a premiere... 
a history of art in 3 colours #bbc & a candle light satsuma bubble bath 
bath, clean pjs and bedding 
how habits and happiness are linked … #enjoylife 
that song, & 13 others can be found on @ amandaroseriley's album, "secrets i told to a sound hole" (out on 3/2). make note of that, because you will want this album. poppy, catchy, singer/songwriter tunes, that are witty & personal, & just make me happy listening to it! 
sat gazing into the skies from a beautiful cottage in a remote scottish village and listening… what did we do to you to deserve this? - acoustic version by #maximopark … 
everything about you resonates happiness, now i won't settle for less #muse 
beautiful tatoo on a beautiful body 
revelation for me results in revelation for you. challenge for you results in challenge for me. what’s awesome about this is that i can constantly send you my #quantum-entangled #love, #peace, and #bliss. it supports you directly because we are attuned. you are loved!

mfw free cheese and wine 
had promising potential, but zero execution and no dramatic hook. painful viewing, and woefully unfunny. 
nice shots of bristol.. but bristol has loads of restaurants you berks. that italian is real though 
hot chocolate #soufflé with creme anglaise 
wayching and it is proper cringe inducing comedy. felt on edge the whole time. totally felt his pain 
then - stephen mangan, heather graham. uk/us sitcom on sky one. 
multi-coloured reality #creation #energy #feelings 
watching comedy drama on #skyone huge fan of stephen mangan but i’m never going to shake my everlong crush on @ imheathergraham (loved episode one) 
ah i did wonder as i posted it on monday. and a non working day for you tomorrow 
i could be completely content each day with oskar curled up in my lap gnawing on a bone for hours. #simplelove #simplethings 
ooh @ skyone bliss is a right hoot! 
loving on @ skyone - and adoring @ missjohartley of course

roaring fire and a tasty drop 
nothing matters more (in the material sense) than my burt's bees pomegranate lip balm. it's like a piece of me is missing when i lose it and like i've found myself when i find it.

on tube heading home listening to roxette and planning a mannequin rewatch... 
at @ apexfilmworks waiting for @ ntlive #catonahottinroof to begin. heart racing with excitement, as usual. #theatrenerd 
what makes pilot a good watch is the sophisticated approach comedy wise to the ever familiar tale of a man stuck between two women. better than your average sitcom. although this is more than a sitcom. 8/10 
my birthday weekend will consist of alcohol, rugby, taking my boy out for ice cream, cake, maybe a present or two and loud rock music. #hurryupweekend

what a way to finish off a friday evening. sipping an ice cold guinness and listening to one of ireland's favourite sons mr #garymoore play live.. 
watched the first episode of #bliss. it's not funny. not even a little bit. but i weirdly like it. 
oh but meeting new people can be #bliss. just like when we met x

cup of tea in bed all nice & cosy with my kindle 
this is @ smallcakesop it's a cupcake & ice cream shop. these are "smashes"- they cut a cupcake in half and place the bottom half in the bottom of the cup, then they add 2 scoops of ice cream, then they top the ice cream with the top half of the cupcake. @ 
mellow magic with the snow falling 
could have been so good especially with heather graham in it but ur man is so annoying in it, comedy in it is shite too 
that feeling of going to bed and not needing to set an alarm for the morning

find this show rather funny! #tv @ 
such a great series, and seemed to get darker and more uncomfortable to watch each week. hoping it's not a full year until the second series? 
extremely disappointed with the ending of which is not a comedy. the hateful character of andrew did get discovered by his 2 wives. 
#wednesday #night on #skyone. 
rare pic of @spike__white on a bus alone 
no better feeling than melting into your bed after you’ve gone to college, done 3 assignments, gone to the gym and showered 
so that horrible selfish man is going to get away with it for another series. we're surely not supposed to have sympathy?
