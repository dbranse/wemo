well the company has the deadline of 1 day for the complaints but all assurances are just on paper.... 10 days peak summer and no one has come to fix the ro.. poor post sales.. #disgusted #dissatisfied #thinktwicebeforebuying

using an arbitrary metric to gauge a person's capabilities to perform a single skill has got to be one of the stupidest notions i've ever heard. especially when it holds little to no weight on the variables surrounding the skill. 
wtf would i want to take a step backwards ?! 
@ att seriously dropping the ball..what i thought was the best customer service yesterday ended up being the worst-false info and pricing. have spoken to 6 customer service reps and lost hours with my kids to “correct” all of the mistakes mallory from va made yesterday. 
in sales you need to give the customer undivided attention, bouncing back and forth between two customers is no way to conduct business @ menswearhouse 
i will never understand at my store during “happy hour” some customers need to announce it to me as if i have no fucking clue. 
why do staff at @ popeyeschicken act like you just asked them to sacrifice their soul in a ritual just for extra sauce. girl just tried to talk me out of it, then charged me(understandable) then didn’t even give me none! talk about ruining my lunch. #popeyes 
finding cute dirt bike riding gear for females is like trying to find a needle in a haystack

@ ikeauksupport unimpressed with the cock up that is ikea! no sympathy no understanding that this is my second trip because they sold me something they couldnt give me then had to faff on refunding a product to buy it again! common fault too i was advised!! #useless 
it's right time when i should stop taking decisions of my life for next 5 years. 
it really annoys me when labour claim their education policies will put #earlyyears first. it's a complete falsehood. labour's education plans put university tuition fees being free first. not early years where the poorest children begin to fall behind.

wth @ wmata i understand there is a fire or smoke emergency on the orange & blue line this morning. however instead of having your passengers go station to station, offer shuttle service at each station rather than have us wait at each platform. #frustrated

@ samsclub scan and go app is excellent. sams grocery pickup is horrible. each time i arrive they as if they have no idea what’s going on. i have to show emails and my app to prove i bought groceries. smh. think i’ll stick with scan and go.

2) a real comparison would include a charge for the use of the road (toll roads might be a starting point). then, rail and other forms of transport suddenly start to look cheap. and that’s before you even begin to compare the effects on the environment. #climatechange 
hey @ directv and @ cinemax it would be really nice if you guys got your programming right. i wanted to watch the mummy (good one w/ b. fraser) which was on the guide, not mummy impossible w/ t. cruise #directvfails

i hate being woken up early on my days off 
@ olacabs please educate your drivers to not to accpets any rides if they don’t want to do the outstation trip. attached is a screenshot for the same. this is so disgusting. this driver asked us to cancel the trip as he wants return fair. what’s the use of ur app. 
people never have a good mindset when they are drunk or tipsy; that’s so beneath me. 
when do you realize that i will do everything for you just to be with you? you should have at least be braver and killed your fear for me. it was easy for you to backout immediately after promising to come. #dontbeshy 
i’m sick and tired of this bitch across from me in lab always starring

corneal exposure. sometimes, the swelling in the orbit pushes the eyeball so far forward that the eyelids don’t close properly. this exposes the cornea (front window of the eye), making the eye feel even more dry, #irritated, and sensitive to #light.

@ carnivalcine but they certainly dont have any issue with tickets booked via bookmyshow. you should train them to accept tickets booked from your website, or should stop selling tickets in your website.

i hope this place sells soon... trying to keep it tidy all the time is getting irritating, especially on a saturday morning... now, to go for a drive during the showing, i guess. 
when you request a day off for a show months before, plan everything accordingly, and spend a fuck ton of money on gas, alcohol, and parking and then show up to the show for hours only to leave right before the artist you came to see #disappointed af

red or blue, idc what side you swing... the native american memes are wrong. making fun of a disgraceful woman by poking fun of native americans in the process doesn’t make you any better. it’s disgusting and wrong. two wrongs don’t make a right.

@ ubereats i’m am sooo done using this service. every time i order food, something is missing or wrong and today was the final straw. this is how my food arrived. how are there no lids? 
dear @ bwwings every time i come to these express locations, they’re always 10-15 minutes later than the time i say i will arrive. i understand chicken takes time to cook, but how is an “express” location slower than the full on restaurant? #lateforworkagain 
@ gutgutiavikaas @ pawangadia @ fernsnpetals your customer care is also poor.. they dont know how to resolve and response...
