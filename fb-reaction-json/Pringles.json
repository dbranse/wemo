My name is Sonya and about a year ago I stepped on a nail and fell down a flight of stairs and in a blink of an eye went from a normal woman married and in love to the same man for 26 yrs. with 2 sons 25 and 23 who are the biggest Falcons fans ever! Sadly because of all my procedures, they had to put cement into nine verta. so that I could live a somewhat normal life. My husband and I were both back in college getting our degrees when I had to quit because just the pain alone was to much to bare. Now I am slowly able to get out of the house, well actually we lost our home a few days ago because my husband had to take so much time off of work to care for me that now we are just living on hope and love. We lost everything and now my oldest son Jonathan has also put is life on hold so we could stay with him in is tiny apart. in Tampa. However in less than a year my husband will graduate and has decided that he will go ahead and go for is MA. and I am going to go back to college within a few months and finish getting my BA. I am telling you this story because when I seen how the NFL loves Levis just as we do I just knew that even though we have no more than 2 outfits each and if I could do anything to thank my husband and sons, I would take them to a Falcons game and make sure they were decked with some great levis but until that day comes. I just wanted to put this out there in cyberspace letting the world know I am humbled and proud of just how much they have given up just for me. I can't wait for the day that I will be able to pay it forward. Much love and Bless you all!",

Over the last few years I have noticed a drop in the quality of these jeans. I have a dozen pairs that have torn in the crotch before I even see any wear on the knee. I haven't had a pair last a year. They use less material on the hem of the pant legs and they roll up and stayed rolled up whether you want them to or not. I always liked the quality of these jeans, obviously something that has been compromised to save money. However, @50 a pair these aren't cheap and the consumers costs keep going up. I do not understand. I expect them to last longer. Until such time as these issues are worked out I will no longer buy Levi's brand jeans. Sincerely.",

At least I thought I did till I went into the Levi store in Lincoln City. Tom and I entered the store and were greeted with a \"can I help you?\"  As Tom wandered off I said to the lady \"yes, I bought this pair of jeans and I like them but forget what they are called, do you have them?\" \nWithout asking me any questions she answered \"well I can tell you we probably don't have what you are looking for. The closest thing we have to a boyfriend cut is the 501. We don't carry anything for curvy girls here. I'm wearing the 501 right now and I don't have ANY curves\" she then proceeded to walk around me once, even pulled the top of my jeans out in the back to look for elastic in the waist. All of this in the middle of the store room floor in front of every customer. \nShe then said something about buying jeans with stretch and something about another store that honestly I don't remember because at this point I was like I deer in headlights. \nIt was then my darling husband turned around from the corner he was in and looked at my face. Walking towards me as the woman asked is there anything else she could help me with. \"No, I think I'll just go.\" I said and started for the door. Tom asked me what was wrong. I told him \"they don't have anything for curvy girls\" and we left. I spent the next 20 min in a complete daze! Something like this has never happened to me before. I'm still not quite sure what to make of it. That woman never asked me what size I am or anything. It almost ruined my shopping for the day. But I needed jeans really bad as I was down to one pair. So I finally went to old navy and got myself some curvy girl size 12s. Thank GOD there is at least one store who's manufacturers carry enough bolts and bolts of fabric to cover my enormous ASS!\nYeah I think I'm a little over being hurt and have moved straight on to mad!",

I went to our local store in Västerås, Sweden, and asked them to fix it. And so they did, except that I had them on for like an hour or two, a few days after the reparation, sitting in a car and they broke again. \n\nThis was on my way to my vacation too so I was really disappointed since I only had one more pair of jeans with me... \nWhen I got back I went to the store and asked them to fix them again. And so they did, but they said that these jeans has a very weak spot between the thighs, especially after the repair. They got sewed again and I took them home.\n\nI put them on this week, did my morning rutines and when I was on my way out the door for school, they broke again! This time I had them on for less than 30 minutes!\n\nI went back to the store with the same jeans for the 3rd time in less than 4 months. The girls at the store told me that this is a weak spot and I told them that this is the 3rd time they brake and I asked for a new pair of jeans. They said that all they could do is to try to repair them, AGAIN! They said that if you have a problem with pants to hold beacuase of your legs bump togheter when you walk, you shouldn't buy these jeans.\n\nThe funny things is that I haven't even got to wear theese jeans for more than a week in total! So that's not my problem this time!\nI am tired of being told that it's nothing they can do about it. \nI want a pair of jeans that holds for more than a week. / Disappointed customer in Sweden",

I have always had a pair, or pairs of Levi's in my closet each and every one of those years.  Why have you forsaken me by not having any denim jeans for women?  Not every woman on the planet wants stretch pants as jeans.  We want Levi's Jeans... you know... like jeans, not stretch pant jeans... jeans.  Recent years I have had to buy the men's button fly, which we all know, don't fit me because I am shaped like a woman, not a man.  Do you have any place near Severna Park MD that sells women's jeans?  I was at your store in Arundel Mills and bought my son his jeans for school and my 9 year old daughter and myself   had nothing made for us in your whole store... I am talking jeans, not stretch pants... Here's to hoping you sell women's jeans again.  Right now, I am sad.  Margie Mardiros",

Levi's does not accept credit/debit cards from many countries... that's fine! However, if you're cancelling orders for dumb reasons like the Billing country or IP address, then why attempt to authorize the transaction? Why cause people's funds to be placed on hold? Why inconvenience your customers in such a way. Let me just say...the mere fact that financial institutions authorize and 'hold' funds for a Levi's transaction, means the transaction more than likely will go through. I have proven that the billing countries Levi's rejects do in fact support VISA and MasterCard that's internationally recognised. Also LEVI'S, you're rejecting countries that strongly support your brand. STOP HIDING YOUR FINE PRINT. LET IT BE LOUD AND CLEAR. YOU CAN ONLY PURCHASE FROM LEVIS.COM WITH A USA IP ADDRESS AND SHIPPING TO A USA MAILING ADDRESS.\n\nBIG BAG OF DISCRIMINATION. Shameful !!! 😡😡",

I walked around that whole store looking for my size, walked it with my wife...looking for a size 44 x 32.... the guy in the store after walking around for 45mins tells me they dont carry that size...young lady working with chimes in saying she works at a couple of stores and shes never seen anything in the 40's and she thinks they cut for Europeans cause Americans sizes are bigger in frame and i would have better luck trying online... really sucks cause i been wearing levis all my life only to find out i can only shop online now. \nJeans are so personal and needs to be tried on first before purchasing cause each cut is different...each look, style and color is different. Im 46, i don't want to wear skinny, tight jeans i want to wear mens jeans...really hate i have to order online for jeans.",

I purchased a Dockers Premium Edition Alpha Khaki from the store and left it in your capable hands to alter it.\n\nWhen I returned to pick up my Khaki, I was surprised to see that the store had used a thread of a completely different colour, and the stitching was substandard.\n\nI expressed my displeasure to the girls at the store. One of the girls who attended to my concern was disinterested in listening to what I had to say. Instead, she mentioned that everyone in Malaysia knows that this is the kind of stitching people get when they get trousers altered. I would like to point out here that I have had a better experience getting my pants altered at a local shop. And I expected even better experience from an international brand.\n\nWhen I asked about the colour of the thread, she mentioned that the store received the trousers today, and they haven’t had the chance to get the thread of the correct colour, and this is the best they can do. I guess she did not think that it was necessary to inform me when I asked her to alter the Khakis. When I insisted, she came back with a couple of options with an expectation that I’ll instruct her which colour to use. I did not think it was my job to suggest the colour of the thread.\n\nI politely asked for an exchange since they were unable to rectify my problem. However, my request was declined by portraying that it was my error that I didn’t know either of the things. Supervisor was less than helpful too. I think they got away because I am not local (I am from New Zealand) and did not raise my voice at them.\n\nThe people at the store were unapologetic for what they did to me. I will urge to people to avoid shopping at Dockers 1 Utama.\n\nI hope that you, Dockers, would listen to me as a customer and not avoid me like people at the store. I expect that someone from your company will rectify my problem.\n\nThanks and Kind Regards,\nVivek",

I bought two pairs of pricey jeans because they fit perfectly in the store, but when I took them home and washed them they were suddenly two sizes too big. And this is right out of the dryer, mind you. I bought them on vacation and I can't return them to that store, nor do I have any Levi's stores near me. Levi's won't let me mail them in to be returned. They are not \"defective\" per se (in that an examination of them would not reveal the problem) so I highly doubt my claim would be recognized by the warranty inspectors. All I want is to exchange them for a smaller size and you're making it impossible. I REFUSE TO BE STUCK WITH $130 WORTH OF JEANS THAT DON'T FIT. I would never have bought them if they'd fit like this. Levi's even claims they're supposed to SHRINK after washing. This is utter crap. What the hell am I supposed to do?",

Have heard lots of amazing reviews before about Levi's jeans and their quality.\n\nHowever it is not even half year past purchase time and it is torn. Even with normal use . I don't do any activities with the jeans.\nIt is very sad, but I checked online and felt better as I saw that you are providing warranty for life. ( or at least for a year......)\n\nwith this idea I went to original shop where I bought it from. all i got was saying that is my mistake and nothing can be done.\n\nI feel that something must be done about it. I do not require necessarily refund, but at least fixing it or a replacement .\n\nBecause it feels like 90euros would go waste now , as i am still a student .\n\n*P. S i have all proof of purchase to send, if needed/\"",

I had the official receipt together with the untouched product still with tag and even plastic cover. Price 250.000 IDR = US$ 18,50.\n\nHowever your employee told me that it is not possible to return it, even though it says it on the receipt (within 14 days of purchase).\nWhen I told your employee about the receipt and tried to explain it to him, he started raising his voice and yelling at me, he introduced himself as Alester or Allister. \nThis has never happened to me before and after letting him know that his behavior is inappropriate and inacceptable I left your store in a very bad mood.\nI am sure, I do not need to tell you that an employee yelling at a customer in a store full of people is not the best advertisement for the brand and company.\nI felt not respected and mistreated as your customer. I appreciate Levi's clothing since 15 years especially for your high quality standards in terms of products, which are internationally.\nUnfortunately, your customer service standards do not seem to be internationally. The sales person in your store is the representative of your company and brand and the only direct contact to the customer, I am sure you do not want to leave such an impression, with me as your customer.\n\nI hope you can help me with this issue.\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA very disappointed Levi's customer :-(",

They were the only jeans that wouldn't do that gapping thing in the back plus they were high quality cotton with just a touch of elastic so they really lasted and wore in beautifully. It's been two years since my last denim purchase and I was sad to see they have been discontinued. I did however purchase two pair of the 711 skinnies and one pair of the 501 cts. The 501s are great! 100% cotton, super comfy yet durable and cool feeling. The 711s however are awful. I didn't realize they had such a high amount of polyester in them. They feel like I'm wearing stretch pants and have an immediate hot and itchy feeling that cotton denim does not have. I regret purchasing them and will return them. This is so disappointing because Levi's were like the last good quality affordable jeans for women out there. I know your men's jeans are still the same as always, so why do clothing companies continue to downgrade the quality of only women's apparel?!? Women want good quality comfortable lasting clothes as well. Maybe I am in the minority on that, but I just thought you should hear one long time customer's opinion. I hope you return to making high quality women's clothing across the board again in the future.",

I don't do any activities with the jeans.\nIt is very sad, but I checked online and felt better as I saw that you are providing warranty for life. ( or at least for a year......)\n\nwith this idea I went to original shop where I bought it from. all i got was saying that is my mistake and nothing can be done.\n\nI feel that something must be done about it. I do not require necessarily refund, but at least fixing it or a replacement .\n\nBecause it feels like 90euros would go waste now , as i am still a student .\n\n*P.

I already wore one pair twice, so I'm sure I can't return them. I bought them as part of a sale at the outlet in Silverthorne, CO where I had to buy two or more pairs to get the sale price. So, if I return one pair, I lose the sale deal. I guess I should have checked to see if my phone fits in the pocket. Even more important, you should know that our increasingly large mobile devices are essential in our lives. \n\nI would think that it would be part of product development to know what people carry in their pockets. I have no doubt that, if you surveyed a large group of Americans on what they carry in their pockets.... Let's say you did this Family Feud style.... The top three answers would include wallet, pen, mobile phone. \n\nSo, why wouldn't you test to see if the most common devices fit in your pockets.\n\nWow, I'm bummed.",

Here's my story. \nOrder 3 pares of 511, same model as I have always worn. Receive them only to find out Levi's has changed the fit completely to the 510. Understandable.\nI return and order 4 pairs of 510, waiting waiting, try to track them, nothing. I call to find out where they might be? Levi's \"Oh your order was canceled because of a credit card incompatiblity on the information, it should have sent you a notification about that?\" I have absolutely nothing in any area of my email. Not to mention when I did the reorder they said it was all set. FINE \nI RE RE order. Finally get the 510s only to find out that all 3 pairs all fit completely different, one is very close to my previous cut, but the other two could house an elephant in the crotch. \nOK fine,  I decide to drive into their outlet store in Seattle. I go to the Levi's online store locator find the Seattle store, and drive in. Park walk around trying to find it to no avail. I finally call, the person answers saying \"Hello Nordstrom\".  I go in figuring maybe its a store in a store, NOPE and they only have a few pairs of Levi's. Funny because it says it's the same as the other two Outlet Stores in WA. So now I have to drive way South to the other outlet store. \n\nMessage Here, DO NOT USE THE ONLINE STORE UNLESS YOU ARE PURCHASING THE EXACT SAME COLOR AND MODEL. \n\nI will say on the positive side the people I've dealt with over the phone have been some of the best I've ever had the pleasure to do so with.",

            "message": "Just popping in to say you guys have some of the worst customer service people handling your online orders. I had an order placed that qualified for a 35% coupon code. Upon receiving the order two of the items did not fit so I went to your store to exchange them for a different size. The customer associate in the store told me that they were online only so I left and called customer service.\n\nThe 1st person I talked to from Levis told me they were out of stock on the items. I had the website pulled up told the customer service agent that I could add them to my cart and Levis online showed them in stock. The customer service agent told me just reorder them and I would have to call back with my order number to have the price adjusted.\n\nThe 2nd person I talked to said since I used a 20% off coupon my 2nd order (to limited the pending charge amount on my card) that she would take an addition 15% after the initial 20%. I told her that \"x\" amount of dollars minus 15% then minus 20% separately did not total 35%. Anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics would understand that. I asked why she couldn't just match the prices of the items and she just repeated she would take an additional 15% off the initial 20%... I told her I would just cancel the order and reorder it with no coupon.\n\nThe 3rd person I talked to said they would issue a refund in the difference of what I initially paid vs what I paid for the reorder. I then waited a few days to see the refunded amount.\n\nI noticed I was shorted just over $28 on the refunded amount a few days later so I called back.\n\nThe 4th Levis representative I talked to said that how the 1st person handled the refund was incorrect and they have been with the department for a long time and knew of a better route. Anyways I explained that I was shorted on my refunded amount and that I would like the difference returned back on my credit card. After a long hold and many corrections on basic math (adding, subtracting and percentages) I was told that the refund would be expected in the next 3-5 business days.\n\nAfter waiting a week I called Levis back today and asked why my refund was talking so long. It appears that the last rep that was so \"experienced\" hadn't left any notes and further more, did not even put in for a refund. The Levis representative I spoke with was helpful but very rude. She cut me off mid-sentence multiple times. Said she was putting me on hold and didn't even let me finish talking. After the hold she asked for more information on the 1st order that I was matching and I gave her the order number. I asked her if I could give her the figures on what I paid the 1st time, what I paid the 2nd time, and the first refund so that she can calculate the difference to be refunded. She said she would do it her self and was putting me on another hold. After another hold the Levis representative said a refund of $7 would be applied. I told her that the refund was supposed to be $28. I then offered to give her the figures again which she listened to. After another hold she said my additional refund would be applied in 1-2 business days. I asked for a confirmation or reference number and she said her computer froze and wasn't able to provide one. So here I am again waiting.\n\nAnyways here I am typing this massive wall of text to let you know that you've lost a longtime customer. After this hassle with your company I don't feel like shopping Levis and going through your customer service ever again. Great product sold by a company who doesn't care about its customers enough to implement easy exchanges or ordering online through a brick and mortar store .",

Incredible read dealing with the truth behind alot of these hartford homocides we read/share about on fb everyday. Something has got to change! & I strongly believe this book has the answer. Spring has just begun & I'm already tired of going to funerals! This is a memoir of my mothers life filled w/ profound deaths & stories that go all the way back to the 60s in Charter Oak Terrace to the present streets of Hartford. Until we get the people in power to understand what really is going on, things will never change. We will just remain \"animals\" (as they call us) slaughtering each other in one of the richest, poverty filled states in the country. Book had me all emotional lol Go out & grab this phenomenal book! Available at Amazon, Kindle, Borders, & Barnes and Noble! R.I.P to all my friends whose story has made it to this book *Video Trailer Coming Soon*",

I recently purchased 2 pairs of 501 and a pair of 541 .not cheap at 65$ a pair . All 3 lasted a total of 3 months and were not even broken in and all 3 the crotch busted out .all 3 ? I love the 501 button fly , has been my favorite for years , but seriously guys maybe 10 wears and the crotch is already busted . I can't keep spending premium money for a product that just doesn't last ........",

I recently bought a new pair and had been wearing them for about two weeks (washing them a few times, of course), when one fateful moment, taking a seat on a low couch at work, and much to the delight of my co-workers--especially Erin--the air was pierced with a comically audible riiiiiip! The seat of the plants split along the left pocket a good eight inches. (Argument in favor of always leaving the house in clean underwear). I returned the pants to Costco, and picked up a new pair, same size and model. Six days later, getting into the car (and out of earshot of Erin and the gang), the new pants ripped. The same exact way. Pocket to cheek. This is all heartbreaking and frustrating, but mostly heartbreaking. I love my 514s (did I mention that?) What gives, Levi's? Thanks!",

            "message": "As a citizen of North Carolina, I am writing to express my displeasure at your opposition to North Carolina’s HB2 law, specifically your clearly insincere political posturing.  You, along with dozens of other companies signed a letter with the Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC expressing your opposition to the law.  Several of the companies on that letter also have either reversed plans to expand into North Carolina, or threatened to stop doing business here because of HB2.To all of you, I ask this: have you even read the law as it was written?  You say in the letter that “HB 2 is not a bill that reflects the values of our companies, of our country, or even the overwhelming majority of North Carolinians.”  Therefore, I would have to surmise that the values of your company include trampling the rights and safety of the many in order to curry favor with a vocal but in reality tiny minority. I say you are clearly posturing and trying to curry favor for several reasons. Allow me to exemplify one with this question if you genuinely believe in nondiscrimination for all people regardless of race, sex, religion or gender identity, then how long have you had gender neutral bathrooms in your place of business? You claim you are standing up for transgendered individuals.  The fact of the matter is, transgender individuals make up only .3 percent of the US population.  Therefore, the majority of your customers are from the 99.7% of Americans.  It is the money of the 99.7% that keeps your company in business.  I feel betrayed by your urgency to be politically correct, rather than remaining loyal to the families that support your business.  You are not standing up for the majority of your loyal customers. Again, in the letter, you say you pride yourself on being “inclusive and welcoming to all.”  Your opposition to HB2 and bullying the NC legislature with threats does not feel welcoming or inclusive at all. HB2 came to be in order to ensure protection for women and children from potential sexual predators. Charlotte’s city council ordinance would have allowed biological males to share the same restroom, locker and shower facilities as women and children. As a woman and mother, I find the accommodation that puts my safety and my teenage daughter’s safety at risk for the sake of political correctness appalling.I would also warn you to be careful that the tactics you use to bully the state in which I live may be turned against your company when you get on the wrong side of the runaway train of political correctness.Shame on you to those of companies who have threatened to or actually pulled business out of NC.  You say you are doing so because of your deeply held beliefs. You have the freedom to do that, thanks to the laws in place in NC.  That right is the exact one HB2 wants to ensure. I encourage you to rethink your stance on this issue, and understand that in this great country in which we live and do business, people can coexist and still hold differing opinions on various issues.",

Now,sadly although your product still brings a premium price,the Quality is nowhere near what they used to be. Levi's used to be the Industry Standard in rugged work wear,Now,sadly it appears all Levis is today is a marketing company.

I have constantly had problems with about 1 it off 4 pair ripping at the pockets or in the crotch and this is what was sent to you guys. These were not brand new but were still in great shape and less than a year old. I'm sorry that your customer support is no longer about taking care of customers. When I find a company loyal to me, I stick with them. But when that company no longer shows loyalty to me, I change companies. Don't worry, I'm not a big spender and would never be a blip on your radar but eventually there will be enough of us that you will notice the cost cutting effort will not pay off.

Yours is the only ad that I've seen that will lock up Hulu and prevent it from continuing to play my show for as long as it takes for me to click on that close button- I tried it out just to see, and your ad stayed on my screen for over an hour; when I closed it, the remaining two ads were over in less than 90 seconds (or six of your audio loops). For shame- you've lost me as a customer for a loooooong time; probably about as long as your commercial (get it? That means forever, since your commercial has no end!).",

Found a good price online with free shipping, so I ordered it. Problem is two-fold. First, the new jacket just doesn't fit right. Same size as my old one, but the cut is very different. Fits shoulders and waist and length is fine, but very tight across chest and sleeves are very tight. It's just unwearable and I doubt that the next size would fit either. And that's ok, but the other problem is that I have to pay $7.50 to return the package. This just doesn't seem fair. Luckily, I had free shipping, because if I had paid for shipping your policy is not to refund that either. So in the worst case I would pay $15 to try a jacket that doesn't fit. I'm unwilling to order another size because you won't do an exchange and with a new order I risk more shipping charges if it doesn't fit. This is not a fair policy for selling clothing online! I am completely disappointed with the Levi's online store and cannot recommend it.",

I've never been more disappointed with how you work with your customers when they show up at your store or call into your call centre. I recently purchased a sweater and a leather jacket online in small and medium each to make sure I got a good fit. I had bunion surgery in mid-August, so I didn't pick up my packages from the store until about two weeks ago. I totally missed the return policy of 30 days from purchase. I assumed it started from the date of pick up. By the time I was able to walk and get the items, my return and exchange period had passed by 10 days for one and 2 days for the other (not crazy time frames) . DIspite showing up to the store today with everything in never worn condition, tags on, in box, receipt in hand standing in my cast, Zara Eaton Centre staff couldn't make any accommodations seeing as I wasn't some weird scammer. What they did offer was for me was to step to the side to call their customer service desk, but even they were less interested in helping me. The woman on the phone just recited the return policy. Neither the in-store staff of the phone agent offered to make the exception and let me choose some other items that I'd actually wear or give me a store credit much less a seat while a talked to the agent on the phone. Now I have $405 worth of things I'll never wear. I'll never shop there again on principle. Note to Zara head office, sometimes you need to just remember that people are people and life happens. Just because you write something on paper or online doesn't mean you can't make accommodations for those who spend their hard earned money in your stores and aren't trying to scam you. You earn loyalty that way. On a positive note, I did get flowers from the doctor who did my surgery yesterday and he does that for all his patients.",

However, in the past eight years or so, I've been noticing that the quality is not the same. Most of the knitwear, the basic cotton t-shirts and coats, don't last more than one season. I literally have to sew new zipers in all the new jeans and dresses I buy, because the original ones are so weak that they stop working after a couple of times. Lucky me, I know how to do it.  I bought a t-shirt two weeks ago and it's already pilling. I have already cut off the labels, so I cannot return it. It's basically trash now. It's really sad, because, as I said, I've been a client for so many years. I feel that, nowadays, it's all about the brand and not the quality.",

            "message": "Sehr geehrtes Zara-Team, \n\nheute bin ich in Ihrer Filiale in Lübeck, Breite Str., in Sachen Kundenservice schwer enttäuscht worden. \nIch habe am Fr., 16.09.,  dort drei Jeanshosen für je 25,95 € erstanden,  letztlich demnach 77,85 bezahlt. \nAm Folgetag habe ich die Waschetiketten in den Hosen entfernt,  wie ich das grundsätzlich bei meinen eigenen Hosen tue,  bevor ich sie das erste Mal wasche. Während ich die Hosen auf links drehte,  bemerkte ich,  dass eine unterhalb einer Gürtelschlaufe ein Loch hatte. Offenbar hatte jemand beim Anprobieren der Hose ein bisschen zu heftig daran gezogen. \nSie fragen sich vielleicht,  weshalb mir dies nicht beim Kauf aufgefallen ist. Diese Frage stellten mir heute auch die beiden Damen an der Kasse,  als ich den Versuch wagte,  die Hose gegen ein intaktes Exemplar umzutauschen. Ich erklärte,  dass ich die schwarze Jeans anprobiert hatte,  und aus Zeitgründen dann die beiden anderen Hosen (davon eine die beschädigte) nicht mehr anzog,  da es sich um die gleichen Modelle,  nur in anderen Farben,  handelte. Ich griff also bei den anderen beiden Hosen nur nach der richtigen Größe und ging so zur Kasse,  ohne die Hosen \"unter die Lupe\" zu nehmen. \nIhre Kolleginnen erklärten mir weiter,  man kontrolliere an der Kasse grundsätzlich die Ware,  die das Haus verlasse,  auf Fehler o.Ä. \nIch bin sicher,  dass dieses Procedere grundsätzlich Anwendung findet. Leider war in meinem Fall eine ziemlich lange Schlange an der Kasse und die kassierende Kollegin arbeitete sehr zügig und hat das Loch offenbar genauso wenig gesehen wie ich. Ich erklärte freundlich,  dass ich die Hose definitiv noch nicht angezogen und das Loch daher nicht selbst verursacht habe. Der Kassenbon belege ja nun auch,  dass die Hose erst kurze Zeit in meinem Besitz war - noch eher zum Untausch zu erscheinen,  war mir aus beruflichen Gründen leider nicht möglich.\nMir wurde von Ihren Mitarbeiterinnen weiterhin erklärt, selbst wenn die Etiketten noch in der Hose befindlich gewesen wären, handele es sich bei dem Loch nicht um einen gültigen Reklamationsgrund,  da man nicht nachvollziehen könne,  wer nun für das Loch verantwortlich sei. So etwas könne aber auch schnell passieren,  da die Hose an der Stelle ja auch \"sehr dünn\" sei. \n\nBei allem Respekt, wenn Sie bei Zara selbst so wenig von der Qualität Ihrer Ware überzeugt sind,  kann ich Ihnen versichern: Ich bin es nun noch weniger und kann sicherlich  nicht behaupten,  dass ich mich als Kundin bei Ihnen gut beraten oder behandelt fühle. Ich betonte auch mehrfach, dass ich kein Geld zurück verlange,  sondern lediglich um den Austausch der beschädigten Jeans gegen ein intaktes Exemplar bitte. Ihre Mitarbeiterinnen kamen mir leider in keiner Weise entgegen. \nDementsprechend bleibt mir nur das Fazit,  dass weitere Einkäufe meinerseits bei Ihnen nicht mehr erfolgen werden.\n\nMit freundlichen Grüßen",

            "message": "Unfair and totally inconsiderate treatment by Zara to customers:\n\nDear Zara \n\nOn the 4th of August, I bought a Trafaluc Denim wear among other items for my wife as birthday present in Zara oxford street branch in first week of august. This was supposed to be a “surprise”, so she did not accompany me to the shop, besides she was looking after a nine month old. On trying all the items, the Trafaluc Denim wear did not fit. I went back to the store in Oxford street for a refund. Now the issue is with the receipt. \n\nYou can understand my shock when I was told by the store staff that there is no refund or exchange without a receipt. In my complete disbelieve, and utter shock, I asked again, only for her to adopt a quite defensive demeanour ‘’I did not make the policy, you have to have your receipt, I am afraid, there are people waiting on the queue”. Without arguments, I went home in search of receipts. I could not find it. I went back the second time, bought more items for my wife, tried to return the previous item explaining that the receipt is not in my house and this is the second time. Not to bore with details but nothing came out of it. Last week Thursday (15th September), I went to buy shorts for my holiday in Spain, paid and tried to return the item the third time. You can now guess how irritated I have become at this point.\n\nI have contacted customer care:\n“Dear Edere, \n\nThank you for contacting Zara.\n\nIn regards to your recent enquiry, please be advised head office have reviewed your case and can confirm that the purchase receipt is required for any exchange or return.\n\nWe do apologise for the inconvenience“\n\n“’I did not make the policy, you have to have your receipt, I am afraid…..”, “…We do apologise for the inconvenience…”: what are you afraid for exactly and what are you apologetic about? Are you afraid because you want to force me to waste my hard earned money? Or are you apologetic because you can’t help but be insensitive to your customers? No matter how polite or rude you put it, or what ridiculous reason is behind this policy, it does not stop it from being one step too far this time. \n\nNow I ask, what is the real motivation behind this complete disregard to your loyal customers. I bought these items as part of an order that included other items. The order is associated with my debit card which I bought them with. I can see it on my bank statement. The Trafaluc Denim wear item is completely traceable through your back office or whatever system you use. Why would you make your customers suffer because of something trivial such as receipt loss when there are ways you can verify the validity of their purchase. These orders are stored in your databases, they are very much accessible to yourselves, there is no denying the truth that my receipt can be reproduced. Why is this option not available to us? Is this not spitting in the face of the very people that have solely made it possible for your business to be where it is today?, that your wages are paid?. How dare you treat us with such rudeness. May I remind you that this is tantamount to biting the very hands that have fed you. There are reasons why the likes of peacocks and bhs have disappeared from our high streets.\n\nThis one is a step too far. It is an affront to the very society that have kept you where you. \n\nOne question for you is: if you want me to keep this Trafaluc Denim wear, what do you want my wife to do with it? Add 4 more stones to be able to fit into it? Or perhaps, you suggest that I wear it instead? Or maybe keep it and waste the money? In these hard times? Or are you punishing me because you are worried I may have shoplifted the item? Every of your customer fits the stereotype? What about the fact that this item can be traced with my bank card, and my person validated in case I am fraud? Or are you simply being arrogantly spiteful towards the very customers that have patronised you? Or are you simply taking your loyal customers for granted by coming up with this totally selfish and despicable no receipt, no refund policy? May I remind you that you are in competition with the rest the retailers and all it takes is for this movement to go viral and it will not be long before the advantage you have enjoyed disappears, before you start to hit below your sales targets, before we all go elsewhere. Can you not implement cloud based receipt system and save yourselves the embarrassment of awful customer reviews?\n\nOkay now, I have worked very hard to save money to buy my wife presents and there is no way on this planet that I will allow you to waste my hard earned money. I want my money back.\n \nI am only just starting with this. One way or the other, I must find a way to feel not ripped off by Zara.",

I bought a jumper from zara Delhi a few days back. The size was not proper and fit not good so I decided to return it. Today at your phoenix store they tell me that because the tag is removed its not in a saleable condition? I have given them the bill, the tags and it is within 30 days of purchase- plus it didn't fit me so how did the manager Ms Madhuri and the associate Mr kamlesh come to a conclusion that because the tags are not there its not in a saleable condition ? This is absolutely absurd and not expected of a brand like Zara . If you have an exchange/refund policy please accept with returns with grace rather than embarrassing the customer. Really upset about this incident and I wish you apply and brief your staff on international standards for retail!",

There needs to be some leniency on the timing of your exchange policy. Every single store has a longer period for exchanges. This is so unfair that you treat your customers like this.

I phoned your customer service who reassured me that this was my only delivery and there was no other parcel to come.. Near on an hour later I've received an email to say that all of my items where packaged in the parcel 'correctly without any discrepancies'! The two items where most definitely not in the box, I would like them or a refund of the money I've paid for them! Your 'investigation' was an incredibly short one.. I'm sure mistakes have been made when packing parcels before! Mistake was not on my end though!",

I had a theft problem in ZARA two days ago. \nI was in the fitting room trying some clothes on. I had a ZARA bag with me theta had an overall that I got from ZARA Germany just recently and a sash from a new Michael Kors bag that I got. Before going into the fitting room, I've asked the employee where I should put the bag, and she told me to place it outside the fitting room as it isn't allowed to have any bags in. However, when I went out of the fitting room, I couldn't find my bag and just found a bag that contained ZARA heels in it. After a lot of negotiation, the employees told me to take the heels that were worth 90JDs and wait until tomorrow and maybe then the woman who took my bag would have it returned and if not, I can't return the heels and buy with that money. Nevertheless, I had in my bag a Michael Kors bag's sash which costed me 250JDs and an overalls which were worth 70JDs (which they don't even have in Jordan). Meaning that what I had in there was worth so much more than the 90JDs heels. \nNevertheless, I came in the next day as they said and had my second shock. The heels that they told I can refund and buy with the money worth it weren't even bought and were on hold! Meaning that I don't even have those 90JDs to buy with! I've then asked to see the cameras and they refused. \nI have no idea what kind of customer service is this. I've been a ZARA customer for over 7 years and this is how you treat your loyal customers? I am extremely frustrated as now I don't even have a EID outfit. I would also like to mention how unprofessional their customer care was! Other than their attitude, they weren't helpful at all and all they did was give me your Lebanese number and your email. \nI would just like to point out that ZARA is a well known, international shop and i would have never expected such a treatment. If they could t keep a bag at their own property, they shouldn't take it in the first place. \nNow I don't have an outfit to wear for Eid and the people that works in Zara were very mean and they didn't do anything they just gave a number in Lebanon and an email to contact with them. \nZara it's an international shop and if they can't keep the plastic bag at the first place, they shouldn't have not let me take it in with me.\nThank you,\nRama Abu Gosh",

Leider ist Massimo Dutti (trotz Kreditkartenbeleg und Originalettiket!!) nicht in er Lage mir die Jacke zurück zu nehmen und zeigt keinerlei Entgegenkommen. Das ist so schade, da bietet H&M sogar bessere Konditionen an und zeigt sich kundenorientiert. Wir sprechen hier von 170€ und es wäre wirklich schön, wenn sich Massimo Dutti wenigstens ein bisschen kooperativ zeigt.

I did not go to the store to get humiliated by your staff. He very adamantly told me that there is only one sales-person on the men's area and the store is not equipped to assist customers. I followed him all the way to the Zara women's store where he directed me to his senior manager Mr Bharat Bhushan, who said that he would look into the matter and won't be able to get the manager to apologize for his rude behavior. It is shocking how your employees treat customers. Thanks again for all the humiliation. I'm never going to a Zara store again and I hope that they keep the same attitude so that you guys keep losing customers. \n-Aditya Arora",

They dint even allow us to see the CCTV camera till we dint threaten them with police. Even the quality of the videos are so pathetic that it's of no use in identifying the faces.

I took it all home to try on and brought it back within 24 hours. When I got home to try on I realized the staff ( young and didn't really care ) forgot to put the receipt in my bag. I even called my coworker who was with me to see if she remembered anything and she thought the associate had given me a copy and kept a copy as she still had it in her hand when we left. I'm guessing that was the only receipt cause there's literally nothing in the bag. Anyway I called very next day to ask for help and the lady just told me I should know the policy if I'm a regular customer and HUNG up on me. Are you kidding ???? If I hung up on a customer , I wouldn't have a business in this day of age. Uh duh....I'm aware of the policy and I stated this has never happened. She didn't even want to listen to me or even attempt to help or even be nice for that matter. I'm now stuck with 150$ worth of clothes that don't fit. How disappointing. Talk about terrible service. Not even an attempt at a solution. I'd say she failed at her test on customer service today.",

Bon, je suis donc retournée dans la boutique Place des Halles à Strasbourg pour leur expliquer ma mésaventure. Quel ne fut pas mon étonnement lorsque l'on me refusa l'échange parce que j'avais coupé l'étiquette intérieure ! Et bien oui, aujourd'hui vous trouvez des étiquettes sans fin, vous les coupez parce que ça gêne plutôt qu'autre chose. Bref, non seulement on me vend un article défectueux mais on ne veut même pas prendre ses responsabilités en acceptant de le reprendre !!

Nadat hij een tijdje had gespeeld ging hij hangen aan de salontafel en huilen.  Wij dachten dat hij zich had bezeerd. Wij hebben hem toen lang moeten knuffelen want hij bleef huilen. Nadat wij hem in bed hadden gedaan moesten wij er in de nacht nog uit omdat hij huilde. Wij maar denken dat hij onrustig was omdat hij zijn speen niet had. Vanochtend werdt hij krijsend wakker. Wij hem weer sussen en een papfles gegeven. Toen ik hem neergezet wilde zetten om te gaan spelen tilde hij zijn voet op. Ik schrok en dacht hij heeft zijn voetje verstuikt eb knoopte gelijk de pyjama open om naar zijn voet te kijken en tot mijn grote schrik zat er een achterkant van een alarm in zijn voet. Daar heeft hij dus de hele avond en nacht dus mee gezeten. Zijn voet is rood en opgezet en heb het gedesinfecteerd en hij kan er niet meer op lopen. ik ben geschokt dat dit kan. Dit zat dus al die tijd nog in zijn pyjama en uiteindelijk is hij erop gaan staan. Ik vindt dit echt niet kunnen. Dit is ontzettend gevaarlijk. Ik bestel geregeld mijn kleding bij Zara en ben dus ook echt geschrokken en vreselijk  teleurgesteld in de Zara. Ik zal de foto's toevoegen en ik hoop op een spoedige reactie.\n\nL.f.Braafheid",

The reason is because I love 100% polyester tees with cool designs that are not made like a jersey and not looking like a jersey. My profile pic shows me wearing a 2014 Zara 100% poly tee. \n\nThe year 2014 had plenty of great designs but as the years have gone by, I noticed that your designers mostly design floral patterns and even then I tried to pull them off. I am a straight man in love with 100% poly tees with cool designs. \n\nMy problem:\n1) Please bring back more designs that are 100% polyester tees.\n2) Your Malaysian website has undergone plenty of changes recently and in the latest update, the fabric information is completely gone from the clothes. The fabric information is crucial for me if I want to know which are the 100% poly tees. Please bring that back. I am not asking for a search filter which is a new thing, just bring back the good old fabric information which you had before.\n\nThank you!",

            "message": "Dear Zara, \nIt seems that I am the next customer from a huge list of disappointed customers. A few months ago I bought a blouse which had a small tore by one shoulder after two days of wearing. After a discussion in the store, the storemanager offered me a new blouse. With suspicious care I tried on the new blouse at home, the tags were still on. After one day the seam was very weak, showed a run and I decided not to wear the blouse before it tore again. I went back to the store and the storemanager neglected my complaint, didn't want to compensate me at all. I got very upset by this. How is it possible that a blouse is tearing after one or two days wearing?! The blouse was more expensive than the average price of Zara clothes (40 euros), so I was at least expecting a little more quality for the price I paid. After calling with the headoffice, Zara told me to buy a new piece of clothing within six months, they were not able to pay me back even when the tags were still on the blouse and I was within the time limit for returning. For now my trust in Zara's quality and customer care has reached the bottom line. According to Dutch law I send a letter to terminate the contract because of default. An email with a confirmation of receiving the letter was send three weeks ago. Again my complaint is being neglected. Zara does not want to take any responsibility for the quality they deliver and asks prices that are not reasonable for this quality of clothes and customer care. Since I am not the first person complaining on this page (it seems like Zara is in default by its customers worldwide), I hope Zara will take steps towards its customer satisfaction and starts with compensating and taking responsibility. They are far behind with this comparing to other stores.",

However, the recent problem that I have experienced has really put me down. \n\nI placed an order to collect in store on 20th July. On your website, it's stated that order can be collected in store within 2 - 3 days, but the order didn't come until 2 weeks after I placed the order (1st August). \n\nDue to this delay, I don't want the order anymore and would like to have a refunds on this order automatically, without having to collect it. But Zara has made it way too complicated that it should be. Zara requested me to go to the store, collect it then process the refund, even though I said it's not convenience for me to go, as the store is far away. \n\nCompared to other shops like Topshop, I get refunds back automatically  if I don't collect the order within 15 days. \n\nPlease improve your customer service. I don't think I want to buy anything from Zara after this problem.",

So you lose about 7-10 returnable days just waiting for your package to arrive. If heaven forbid, like myself, your package fails to be delivered and you leave for vacation, you are out of luck. Zara will just tell you that you a) should have waited to pick it up or b) mailed your return back from your house (aka the one you are physically not at because you are away). Wouldn't even issue a gift card which would have to be spent at their store anyways. Did I mention this occurred a mere few DAYS after their strict ass month policy?

Perhaps we could put the fizz back in to our communications by using Facebook? As they say, a change is as good as a rest. Just to recap, in case you've forgotten, I purchased a pair of shoes from you on line. I loved those shoes, I adored them. It was shoe heaven. Unfortunately, when they arrived, they showed signs of having been worn and the leather was quite creased, although the label was intact.When I stopped crying over such a life changing disaster, I returned the shoes to you. It was lovely to hear from you when you rang me and it was the start of a very special relationship I thought. The phone call I made to you on 28th July at 16:32 where I discussed the shoes with your lovely call handler was resolved. You would issue a refund. Thank you. All sorted, or so I thought. You obviously liked the sound of my voice and chose to put in several further phone calls to me. When I got chance to ring you back, you told me there was no record of a refund being agreed. Anyway, I'll get to the point. After many email exchanges it appears you 'have no record' of my phone call to you on July 28th at 16.32. Very strange as you record all your calls. I did help you out by sending you a photo of my phone showing the details of the call. Our relationship was going through a turbulent stage, and you dumped me by sending back the shoes. I won't lie to you Zara, I was very upset by you ending our relationship so abruptly. Still, I don't want to be one of those bitter and twisted exes but would like to say this, under the nice new Consumer Rights Act (2015) our as I like to call it our 'Pre Nup' you have to offer a full refund if the goods purchased are faulty. Which they were. We both know that and I know its hard to move on after the ending of a relationship, Zara, but hey, the laws on my side and I really think you need to check your phone records again to find ouot phone call. An apology would also be nice and we can part amicably. Hoping my heartfelt letter to you lasts longer than 25 seconds on your glossy page and that you haven't moved on from me already. Because, after all, you need to learn from 'us' in order to treat future relationships you may have with respect.\nTake care Zara\nWith my best wishes \nHeidi",

We trek all over town to find the right size and when we finally do the sales associate refuses to exchange a size (not asking for a refund or different product). Siting it's been 3 months and they won't help. This is not ok. This is for a wedding. If they had of had the proper help in the beginning they would have had suits that fit properly. How can @Zara not even exchange a size when it's a suit that is continually carried and when all tags, hangers and garment bags have been left on?",

So I thought, great it will be slightly less than that in Pounds.\n\nThe girl at the till scanned it in an to my complete surprise it came up at £39.99!!! When I questioned she apologised and said we will mark it down the £35.95 which I accepted.\n\nWhen Manager Veronica came over, she abruptly said she would not reduce the price, and the reason it was more expensive was due to shipping costs..... In rough numbers you're saying it costs about £8 a bag to post, who is running you logistics operations!?!?!?\n\nVeronica said the till girl was wrong to offer a price reduction (bit humiliating for the girl), and did I want the bag or not as she would/could not agree to reduce the price as marked.\n\nAs the manager was quite stand offish and with a queue forming behind me I decided to buy the bag and make a quick exit (which was not so quick as a tag was left on the bag meaning I had to make my back into the store to have deactivated).\n\nCertainly not a good experience, and will make me think twice of whether to bother buying in Zara in future!",

This is not good customer service and she should have done more to help. I had my baby with me and felt embarrassed at the cash desk and now have a pair of shoes that are not suitable.

But this time I had faced a lot of inconvenience and mental harassment. When I purchased this trousers (attached pic), I had asked for alteration,they refused stating that due to peek sale session it can't be done right now, please bring it after 03rd of July. Second time when I went on 05th July, the tailor master was not available that time so I had to come back without getting it altered. Third time when I went on 10th  August, again the tailor master was not available and the lady asked me to drop it and collect it next day. Also she informed me that an alternation will cost you Rs 60 which was quite surprising for me as I had never paid before to\nZara or any other store for alteration. I asked to call their manager, after 20 mins of waiting time, a person by the name of Mr. Abhishek came with Beetlenut (PanMasala) in his mouth very casually and straight away gave me an I'd \"Cutcare@in.inditex.com\" to write my issue. \" I WAS TOUCHED WITH HIS SERVICE EXCELLENCE AND I MUST APPRECIATE ZARA TO HAVE THIS KIND OF MANAGERS ON THEIR PAYROLL WHO SPEEK WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH PANMASALA IN HIS\nMOUTH\". KUDOS \nPlease give me a one good reason that why I should not escalate the above issue in Consumer court or\non social media wherein : \n\n1. Neither it was mentioned on the\nbill nor in the store that customer will have to pay the\nalteration charges?? \n\n2. Where it is written on the bill or\nin store that in Sale time alteration will not be done?? \n\n3.Why should a customer bear the cost of transportation and\nparking charges everytime because of your lack of\nresources??\n\nHope to get a response with compensation details\nbefore Monday else I'll be forced to file a case against\nInditex in Consumer Court.",

We went into a store but the lady in the store helped us buy the product online. One of the pants did not fit, so we had to purchase another pair. When I went to return the pants after the wedding I was informed I had missed the return deadline, however due to the fact that none of the receipts I received had any indication of the return policy a lady at customer service helped me return the product. Finally after a month I received a call telling me I missed the deadline to return and they were sending it back to me again. How frustrating and not even my fault!!!!",

Và một ngày chỉ đủ sức đăng được 1 lần như thế. Nếu bạn dùng #udlamgiau , bạn chỉ mất 1 phút để đăng 720 Groups một ngày hoặc đăng vài nghìn Groups nếu bạn cho chạy đồng thời nhiều tài khoản.\n.\n👉 Nếu bạn đăng thủ công thì lúc ăn, ngủ, đi ra ngoài, … nó trở thành “thời gian chết” trong quỹ thời gian kinh doanh của bạn. Nhưng nếu có @udlamgiau thì vấn đề đó sẽ được giải quyết triệt để.\n.\n👉 Sự khác biệt là rất lớn, nhưng chỉ mất chưa tới 1.000Đ/ngày để nâng khả năng tiếp cận khách hàng của bạn lên một tầm cao mới. Bù lại, nhờ tiếp cận được với nhiều người, những người có nhu cầu về sản phẩm của bạn cũng tìm được tới bạn nên số lượng đơn hàng sẽ tăng lên. Chỉ 1 – 3 đơn hàng gia tăng đã giúp bạn đủ trả chi phí cả năm rồi, thời gian còn lại là lúc nó mang lại lợi nhuận cho bạn. Mà hơn thế, nhờ @udlamgiau lượng khách hàng tiềm năng vẫn liên tục gia tăng.\n.\n👉 Thay vì cắm mặt vào máy tính hay smartphone để đăng bài và chấm chấm ở comment mới có khách hỏi hàng, thì ăn cũng có khách hỏi, ngủ cũng có khách hỏi, chơi cũng có khách hỏi mua hàng…\n.\n👉 Đầu tư một tài khoản @udlamgiau chỉ với 360k/năm để có thể chạy đăng bài ngay cả khi tắt máy và có thể sử dụng trên tất cả các thiết bị với việc mua một phần mềm vài triệu mà khi nào bật máy phần mềm mới hoạt động thì bạn sẽ chọn cái nào???\n.\n👉 Chi phí 360k/năm hoạt động, tính ra chưa tới 1.000Đ/ngày, trong khi nhờ ứng dụng, bạn chỉ cần bán được thêm một đơn hàng là bù đắp được gấp cả trăm lần phí dùng ứng dụng của ngày hôm đó, chưa nói tới việc nhờ ứng dụng mà có thể tăng 10 – 30 đơn hàng 1 ngày. Một sự đầu tư quá lợi!!!\n.\n☀ CÓ PHÍ KHÔNG NHỈ?",

Była tylko jedna sztuka i miała dokładnie takie samo rozdarcie ( niedokładne przeszycie na szwie). Przyszłam z tą sukienką do przymierzalni - Panie odesłały mnie do kasy, abym porozmawiała z Managerem i otrzymam upust za wadę. Poszłam do kasy. Pani przy kasie mnie wręcz wyśmiała. Rzuciła sukienkę do pudła i oświadczyła że towar wybrakowany odsyłają do zakładu...Nie ma szansy na żaden upust. Sukienka kosztowała 199 zł i miała wadę taką, że trudno było by samemu to ładne zszyć - upust ok 30 - 40 zł spowodowałyby że sukienkę bym kupiła i była zachwycona empatią ekspedientek, a sklep polecałabym koleżanką. A tak - macie niezadowoloną klientkę. A na koniec najlepsze - sukienka była po południu wystawiona znów jako pełnowartościowy towar w sklepie! Ktoś  się  nabierze. Tyle razy robiłam u Państwa niemałe zakupy dla siebie i dzieci - nie rozumiem takiego podejścia do klienta, a już wywieszenie tego towaru....dla mnie nie uwierzenia.",

            "message": "Hello,\n\nI want to report my unpleasant experience I had with Zara stores in Frankfurt.\nIt actually happened last month.\nI thought it wasn't worth to write about at first.\nBut I was writing about racism experiences I have faced as an Asian woman living in Europe, and thought this particular one might need your attention.\n\nSo here it goes.\n\nIt was in the store in Frankfurt Konstablerwache. When I made the purchase, the cashier didn't give me the receipt directly onto my hand. I thought she might have put it in the bag with the clothes because they do that sometimes.\nThe queue was very long, and I didn't want to waste other customers' time, so I stepped aside the queue and went through the bag to make sure that I wasn't mistaken about not getting the receipt.\nThe receipt wasn't there, so I went back to the cashier and told her that she hadn't given me the receipt. \nApparently she was very annoyed and asked me to double-check my pulse. I did so in front of her. It wasn't there of course because she never gave it to me.\nShe told me angrily that next time, if I don't get the receipt, I'd have to tell them immediately. I told her that I thought she might have put it in the bag, but she cut me talking and said \"No, No.No.\"\nShe gave me a new receipt with no prices on, but said it shouldn't be a problem to return or exchange.\n\nAbout a week later, I went to another Zara store in Frankfurt Hauptwache. I picked up some new clothes and wanted to return some clothes I bought before. When the cashier here saw my receipt, she seemed a bit confused and upset because there was no prices on. She spoke to her colleague, and this colleague explained her some stuff. Now they both looked quite annoyed, then asked me if I had the master card I had used to pay for the 1st purchase with me. I said I did and showed it to them. But they went \"Are you sure? This is the card?\" I said yes, and then they asked again \"100% sure?\"\nI said yes again. I felt like I'm some sort of credit card thief? I tried to explain them what happened at my earlier purchase and the receipt but they weren't listening but just speaking to each other in German.\nFinally all the process seemed to be almost done. Now they needed my signature on some kind of return receipt. At this moment, an old Chinese lady came to the cash desk and put her stuff on it. I guess she thought I was done there. Okay. It was rude of her to not wait for her turn and just expected to have her stuff checked out like that. But what's even more rude was that the cashier pushed the lady's arms off the cash desk without saying anything but only with the very annoyed face. Like she's not even a person. I mean, the cashier could've just said something like \"Please wait on the queue.\" Is it too crazy to do that?\n\nMaybe it's just me overthinking, but I feel like if I were white, this wouldn't have happened. I mean, cutting while I talk, never saying sorry, blaming me, and making me feel like a thief.\n \nIf it wasn't anything to do with racism, then you probably want to consider training your staff to be less rude in general.\n\nI'm sorry for such long post and thank you for taking your time and reading.\n\nThanks.",

Ich schneide also alle Preisschilder und Inlayschilder ab, damit ich das ganze Sammelsurium erstmal waschen kann. Da fällt mir bei einem Zweierpack Langarm-Strampler ein Diebstahlschutz auf. Ein Diebstahlschutz??? Bei Onlinebestellungen? Ernsthaft? Leider bin ich aufgrund meiner mangelnden \"Dieb-Erfahrung\" nicht im Standesamt dieses Ding selbst (ohne Schäden an den Stramplern zu machen) zu entfernen... zumal, wie gesagt, mir die Notwendigkeit bei vorausgezahlten Nachhauselieferungen sowieso äußerst fragwürdig erscheint...  \n\nMit den beiden BEZAHLTEN Teilen kann ich nichts anfangen und ich ärgere mich schwarz, dass ich mir bei 30 Grad mit 4-monatigen Baby den Weg in die Stadt ersparen wollte, weil ich ihn jetzt wahrscheinlich eh gehen muss, um dieses Ding entfernen zu lassen!\n\nÜber eine Reaktion Ihrerseits freue ich mich!",

I ordered some clothes on Thursday and I paid £9.95 so I could have my clothes delivered In time for my first holiday I've had in 5 years on Monday, it didn't get delivered and when I phoned your customer service line I was told my order wouldn't get to me until Monday! If I knew it would have come on Monday I would have done the free delivery! And your staff told me there was nothing they could do about it, not even a refund for the delivery charge! Not impressed, and now I have no clothes for my holiday :(",

Apparently the store return policy is different to the website return policy, but this is not made clear on the website.\n\nThey offered me an exchange, so I went about the store looking for items to exchange with, when I took these to the counter I was then told that once I make this exchange that even if my new items don't fit me I can't take them back and exchange for the correct sizes?\n\nThis policy seems absolutely bizarre to me! When they first told me I could get an exchange they didn't inform me that it also had very strict conditions.\n\nI'm a loyal customer of Zara's and shop there every month, so was very surprised and distressed by the treatment I received today.",

My family  has been wearing zara since its inception.  my 1 yr old grand son  also has been wearing zara since his birth. So for me to write this has been very difficult.I bought a pair of shorts from the baby boy section and it said in the wash care that it will fade. Since I am from the garment trade  since 40 yrs I understand that the garment is overdyed . But this particular garment in question has excessive bleeding. There is a difference between bleeding and fading. When I explained this to your store manager mr swapnil pawar at the high street phoenix, mumbai store he just ridiculed my knowledge. My daughter also works as a design head for kids wear in a reputed indian corporate and can understand the technicalities of the product. This is no way to behave with a loyal customer and specially when he knows the subject well. You need to train your store managers to deal with customers appropriately. An exchange was all that he needed to do. Instead of that he was very adamant and arrogant. You need to justify this kind of behaviour as its highly unacceptable. I got so agitated with the whole scene that I left the garment at the store and walked off. I dont know if this show down was highlighted to you guyz but as a concerned consumer I had to do it. Pls let me know how you are going to tackle this issue. Zara needs to keep up to their reputation and hire more knowledgeable and responsible staff. The least that swapnil pawar  could do was to be kind enough an offer an exchange and speak well to a customer who is his fathers age. I m expecting a positive feedback on the above situation asap.",

            "message": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing in to lodge an official complaint on today's Yeezy 350 V2 launch happening at your adidas Originals store located within Pavilion Mall, KL. I trust the upper management of adidas Malaysia will look into this complaint officially and seriously, and I demand a speedy response from your good office. Please kindly take note that without an acceptable response from your good office, I would raise the case to the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) and Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (FOMCA).\n\nJust to provide an overview of what happened since as early as 5AM in the morning. A line started right in front of the main entrance of Pavilion Mall by the Hibiscus Fountain, with your loyal customers lining up as early as before 5AM in the morning. I reached and joined the queue at approximately 7.45AM, with about 250-300 people lining up in front of me. The first few in the queue was told by the security guards that it was the \"official queue\" for your Yeezy 350 V2 ballot tickets.\n\nAt approximately 9.30AM, hundreds of people rushed in to the front of your retail store from all different routes and entrances. Those at the first 100-200 in the line were dumb founded, only to realise their effort to start queuing were futile. Hence, there was no more queue, only chaos.\n\nTo be fair to the management, it could not be considered 'wrong' for not providing the consumers a proper queue system. However, this is surely a case of mismanagement, since adidas Malaysia had done launching and balloting for various Yeezy's and NMD's since nearly 2 years ago. We as consumers have sufficient reasons to believe that, by now, adidas Malaysia should have known how to better manage the frantic crowd.\n\nNow let me raise the most unacceptable clear cut case of consumer mistreatment.\n\nThe ballot ticket registrationwas delayed for only 5 minutes, and started at 10.05AM. However, upon approaching your store manager and retail staffs of adidas Originals @ Pavilion 3 times, I could not be given a simple answer for a simple question - \"What is the total number of ballot tickets available for the Yeezy 350 V2 launching this Saturday?\"\n\nYour store manager first told me that the ballot ticket registration is supposed to be managed by a 'Third Party' which happened to be late for the registration. Upon further questioning, only to realise that the 'Third Party' she claimed is actually a team from adidas Malaysia HQ. She promised to call me back upon speaking to her 'HQ' to inform the number of ballot tickets available.\n\nYour store manager kept her promise and called me back after approximately 20 minutes, from the retail store's landline - 03-2141 8198. Unfortunately, she gave me no answer, only to quote her 'HQ' for saying \"the number of ballot tickets available cannot be revealed\".\n\nHence, kindly enlighten me a question that your store manager failed to answer on behalf of her company. Why is the number of ballot tickets available for the Yeezy 350 V2 raffle not allowed to be announced to the consumers queuing for the tickets? We were not asking for the number to be disclosed a day before, an hour before or 10 minutes before. The registration for ballot tickets had already started, and yet the long queue of consumers were made to queue and wait for their ticket which they have no idea if they could obtain.\n\nHow many skipped school? How many called in their office for MC or Emergency Leave? Have some empathy on the consumers who paid for your operational costs and your salaries please.\n\nI am very unsatisfied with your lack of management on simple activity / event coordination, the consumers deserve to be treated with dignity, so does your retail team members. Please do not put so much unnecessary stress and anxiety on your retail crew and the poor consumers.\n\nAn email of the same content had been sent to all members of management a moment ago. Your kind response is highly appreciated.\n\nRegards,\n\nSebastian",

Jedoch für sein Alter noch sehr verspielt und noch nicht entsprechend entwickelt, was das Spielverhalten betrifft. \n\nLeon lud vor Wochen einige seiner bisher engeren Freunde zu seinem Geburtstag ein, der entweder eine Schatzsuche hätte werden sollen oder ein Tag in einem Indoor Spielplatz. \n\nleider haben alle anderen Kinder abgesagt. \n Einige mit der Anfrage, ob man nicht mal zum Bowlen oder zum Laserteck gehen könnte...dafür interessiert Leon sich aber noch nicht.\n\nLetzten Endes feiert Leon seinen Geburtstag dieses Jahr ausschließlich im Kreise seiner Familie, was er natürlich sehr zu schätzen weiß, jedoch fehlt ihm der altersgerechte Anschluß...\n\ner ist dieses Jahr unheimlich traurig, weil er der Ansicht ist, daß mit ihm etwas nicht stimmt, weil sich die Kinder von ihm Abwenden und scheinbar nichts mehr mit ihm anfangen können.\n\ner gibt sich selbst die Schuld, zweifelt viel an sich und ist zur Zeit in einer schwierigen Phase des Selbstzweifels, was mich als Mutter unheimlich traurig macht und mir lange überlegt habe, wie wir Leon an seinem Geburtstag eine besondere Freude machen könnten.\n\nEs sollte nichts mit materiellem zu tun haben, sondern etwas für das Herz sein, etwas besonderes. \n\nDa Leon ein..für einen Jungen seines Alterns außergewöhnliches Hobby entwickelt hat, kam mir dazu die passende Idee..\n\nLeon sammelt und liebt schöne Postkarten. \n\nDarum habe ich mir als seine Mutter, die eigentlich eher sehr introvertiert ist...die Idee und den Aufruf rausgenommen, hiermit im sozialen Netzwerk an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen und viele Menschen zu erreichen...mit der Bitte...falls sie eine Postkarte übrig hätten...Leon vielleicht einen Geburtstagsgruß mit ein paar lieben Worten zu senden...\n\nSomit bekommt er Post von vielen Menschen, die er nicht kennt/ die ihn nicht kennen..denen er es aber trotz alledem Wert ist, sích die kleine Mühe zu machen, meinem Sohn ein Lächeln ins Gesicht zu zaubern und ihn davon zu überzeugen, daß er es für all die Menschen Wert ist...weil er wirklich ein einzigartiger, besonderer Junge ist, der es verdient hat, daß es Menschen gibt, die seinen Geburtstag mit einer kleinen Geste der Nächsteliebe bereichern....\n\nPost ginge somit an : Stichwort \" : Geburtstagsaktion für Leon Röhl\"\n Unser Lädchen / 53560 Vettelschoß...\n\n( Eine Straße oder Hausnummer ist noch notwendig, da Unser Lädchen die Postannahmestelle ist)\n\nIm Vorhinein bedanke ich mich ganz herzlich für die Anteilnahme bei jedem Einzelnen, der sich bereit erklärt, meinem Sohn diese Freude zu erweisen. Herzlichsten Dank! Stefanie Prange",

I've become completely fed up with wearing them because of the continued squeak they make with every step I take. This was never an issue with the first three pairs I bought (maybe a slight squeak the first couple days but certainly not persisting beyond that). I was even going to the extreme of applying a daily coat of talcum powder between the tongue and the rest of the shoe to try to silence them but it has gotten to the point where I no longer have the patience to continue this ridiculous routine. Have I a bought a defective pair or are all new SAMBA models prone to this annoyance? I asked the store where I bought them what I could do and they said there was nothing they could do. I wouldn't recommend Adidas shoes after this frustrating experience.",

My favourie childhood sneakers :D 3 months ago I bought new pair of superstars and after these 3 months they're looking worse than my 6-yo pair... They broke inside and outside!! I took them to shoemaker and he told me that many many people gave this model to fix!! Before I gave it to shoemaker I took it to your brand store to make complaint but unfortunately they don't accept returns or exchange. Your shoes were really good quality, but now they're shitty like made-in-china cheap sneakers from bazaar. In my opinion it's deceive and now you have one client less. (Sorry for my English, it's bad like your fu**ing superstars).",

Es waren zudem auch noch meine Hochzeitsschuhe !!!!! Man sagte mir Adidas hätte kein \"A\" mehr und deshalb könnte man nicht JANINA0909 auf den Schuh drucken (komisch: das erste A wurde gedruckt: JANIN0909) Somit kamen die Schuhe zwar früh genug, aber falsch personalisiert - jedoch zu spät um die Schuhe nochmals zu bestellen !!! Ich könnte kotzen und habe mir jetzt ein paar Nike Air Max BW dafür gekauft, denn Nike hatte noch ein \"A\" 😂 (wenns nicht so traurig wäre, müsste ich grad lachen) ! ich habe \"euren\" Fehler bei der Bestellbestätigung bemerkt und ca. 1 Stunde danach gleich bei der Adidas Hotline angerufen, die Dame mit komplett russischem Akzent meinte das sei jetzt Pech und ich soll halt warten bis die Schuhe kommen aber die brauchen sowieso 5-10 Tage 😂😂😂😂Und NEIN liebe Frau - ich mag den Schuh mit dem falschen Namen meiner Frau dann nicht für 15% weniger behalten ! Ich gebe ihn zurück und bedanke mich für meinen versauten Hochzeitstag ! Wenn ihr gewollt hättet, hätte man direkt reagieren können - aber dazu fehlts leider an der deutschen Sprache eures service Teams und an Kompetenz! DANKE FÜR NICHTS !",

I don't care what his artistic vision was, and I do not want to hear about how little you knew about the events that were going to unfold  prior to the show, etc. He is representing your company and therefore you are at fault as well. You have a obligation to those that support you to speak up, otherwise it is fair to assume you support this ridiculousness. I can not support a company that condones behavior such as Kanyes. It is disgraceful and you should be apologetic and embarrassed to be associated.",

There were only two large jackets displayed so I asked an associate for some help. The associate was happy to assist and the only one in the store who seemed so. Unfortunately, they were out of my size. I went to the fitting room to try on a few other items and when leaving the fitting room I went to hand my items to the associate (working the fitting room) my unwanted items (which I hung myself as I also work in retail) and the associate put his hands up and said, \"You can put it back yourself\". I was a bit in shock because generally associates working fitting room areas would take your items. He proceeded to tell other clients to hang and run items to the floor themselves. A few minutes later I then ask if it would be possible to place an order in store to be shipped to my home. I was told no but I could, \"do it myself online\". No alternative options were given to check another store or anything. I was really disappointed in the customer service as I would expect something more from such a responsible and well known company. Working in retail is by no means an easy job, I will be the first to admit. However, the front runners of a company are the retail workers and it seemed as though business and customers were not first priority. I found the Broadway location with my size in the items I wanted with great help at the register. But asking customers to put things back themselves, and not assisting in doing everything they can to make a sale just seems a little odd to me.",

Pidió nota de crédito pero se negaron en hacer la devolución ya que por políticas de \"Adidas\" no les harían nota de crédito, que eso estaba informado en el ticket adjunto a la boleta, un poco irrisorio ya que el ticket sale posterior a la compra y eso no fue informado antes de comprar, entonces les mostraron un cartel con sus políticas que está detrás del mesón de atención y que además en ese momento estaban tapadas con unas cajas de otras zapatillas, mi sra. Un poco molesta por la situación levanto un poco la voz y la encargada de tienda en ese momento no tuvo mejor idea que llamar a los guardias de mall plaza, ósea que más puedo decir muy mala Atención de parte de los encargados que indicaron de manera déspota que además ella no había sido la que compro y que no tenían porque hablar con ella, que por nada no harían la nota de crédito y que se dirigieran al sernac (muy ético de su parte), más encima mi sra. Pregunto cuando llegarían modelos nuevos y le indicaron que fuera a la tienda a revisar ella, que no tenían fecha de llegada de productos, que podía ser entre un mes, dos meses... \nyo hoy fui nuevamente a hablar con el jefe de tienda el Sr. Guillermo Andres Arias el cual me atendió de manera amable, pero volvió a reiterar que por políticas de \"Adidas\" solo podemos realizar nota de crédito solo de podrá realizar cambio de producto...  \n\nA todo esto tuvimos que incurrir en comprarle otras zapatillas a mi hija en otra tienda y de otra marca después de este incidente ya que tenía un cumpleaños y necesitaba unas zapatillas nuevas, Si necesitan les envió fotos de la boleta y producto para que vean el estado en el que se encuentra.\n\nAtte.\nJonathan Carrasco.",

I went to the branch and I met someone called Tamer Amin \"Maybe he is the branch manager not sure\"; he was respectable but he didn't want to listen to me at all and all he wants to prove that the perfume is normal. I even told him to test himself to check it but he refused. I didn't want my money back, but I wanted another usable one as the one I have is really like water.\nI'm an Adidas customer and this is first time to face this problem.\nI have the receipt mentioning that return/exchange could be in 14 days, but he refused to give me another one as well.\nKindly advice about this problem as this wasn't Adidas standard.\nI'm very disappointed from the quality of the perfume I got!!\n\nWaiting for a contact,\n\nRamy Makram\nAlexandria - Egypt",

I have been expecting to receive the shoes this weekend. How can Adidas just sent me an email telling my shoes won't be shipped anymore?! Since this is a limited edition, how can you ask me to find another pairs? \n\nMy sister ordered another pairs of NMD_R1 even after I placed my order; however, there is no problem with her order. \n\nI need a clear justification. \n\nSophia 8/26/2016",

I was using a self check out and I went to scan a sweatshirt I had and noticed it didn't have a tag so I had the employee come over and he told me it would be too hard figuring it out or getting help since it was a min until closing so he took the item from me and said 'I don't know what to tell you. I guess you can come back another time.' I told him I could see the rack where they were and we could grab another one and he said no, that we could come back another day. I've tried finding this sweatshirt in my size at another Target and couldn't so I was happy to find it at this one but then was shocked when this guy told me he wouldn't help me so I could buy it. I feel like this isn't the service I typically receive at your store but it is still completely unacceptable. It would have taken him less than a min to run over and scan a different one but apparently he was more concerned with going home than he was doing his job.",

Los audífonos que se encontraban al interior son los Bose QC25, los que además vienen incompletos debido a que no traen el cable de audio. Me dirijo a ustedes para que se analice la situación y me puedan dar una solución con respecto a la compra, ya que no corresponde el producto contenido en la caja.

However, when the associate pulled up the order page for the item I wanted, whoever ordered before me didn't sign off THEIR account, and your associate didn't make sure that they signed off, and I was unaware that I was ordering under another account. So now my order is being sent to a random address, and also, I put in my debit card information which now there is a chance that this OTHER random person has access to and can use my information to order as they please on their account. So not only does this other person have my name and address, but they possibly have my debit card info.

I took my coupon home and placed the stools in my cart (and got an amazing deal on them), went to check out and my coupon wasn't working! Typically if it were to be only a dollar or so off my total, I would say forget it, but using my coupon would save me almost $50! I decided to call customer support. From the time the phone started ringing to the time I hung up after they fixed the issue, it was just over 4 minutes! That's by far the fastest I've ever been on the phone with ANY customer service center. NOT ONLY THAT but the nice lady on the other end congratulated me on getting married TWICE.

First off, even if one has a birthday that falls on Election Day, I don't believe that you should be carrying any cards with any candidate on it, simply because of the polarizing nature of this election cycle. Secondly, it's not okay to carry a card with a depiction of Trump and especially not one that takes a song that many people of color hold in such reverence. It's in bad taste. Seeing as though the local store wouldn't do anything about the card, I took it upon myself to make certain that no other person of color be subjected to that. I hid them well, somewhere in the store. Perhaps it's time to think about how items on your shelves make your shoppers feel. 😡😔",

The cashier called the supervisor over. He seemed put out that he had to go look for the tag on the shelf, but did it. He came back and because I had let the next person in line go ahead of me did bring me to another register. His attitude toward me was rude, his exact words were \" first of all, someone marked the shelf wrong, this is for a pewter storage basket,but I'll give give you that price \".  \nThe regular price was 24.99, I got it for 21.24....3.75  was not really worth the attitude. I worked retail for many years, I know that things get ticketed wrong, I know things get put on shelves where they don't belong. There were several of these large greyish baskets for 24.99 behind the sale sign for 21 .24  for large pewter storage baskets reg price 24.99. \nThe words \" first of all\"--- probably not the best choice to start a sentence with in the customer service industry.",

The dining table arrived damaged - unbeknownst to us because the instructions say to leave the plastic wrap on while assembling. When we completed the assembly and removed the protective covering we discovered the extent of the damage, on all sides of the table.  This is a 72\" table that weighs over 50 lbs.  When I called into your online support, I was told by the first representative, Ronaldo that the item was discontinued.  I found this strange since on your site the table has a cute little banner that says, \"New at Target\" when I went to see if it was still listed on the site, Ronaldo hung up on me.  I called back in and asked to speak with a supervisor.  Horace began to assist, and initially he seemed as though he was going to help me resolve this issue.  When covering our options, he told us we could bring the 72\" table in to a Target store to get a refund and place a new order - that would most likely get cancelled because the item is discontinued.  When I explained that would not work, because I drive a small vehicle and this table would require some sort of freight to move, Horace offered to have it picked up.  He then explained that in order for us to arrange a pick up we would need to disassemble the table and \"put it in a box\".  My fiance and I explained that there would be no way for 1. us to find a box to fit a 72\" dining table and 2. we are not packaging engineers and would not be able to accomplish this task.  Horace then said he would offer us a $20 Target gift card to buy a box... not only was this insulting but was in no way resolving our issue. Our time assembling, disassembling, hunting for a box and packing is worth more than $20, and to be quite frank I am absolutely sure that a box that could fit and ship a 50 lb 72\" dining table would cost more than $20. To make this long, disappointing story short, according to Horace, we have no way to get a new table sent to us and we cannot get a refund unless Target gets the damaged goods back, so we are stuck paying for a damaged piece of furniture. This has been one of the most disappointing customer experiences I have had.  Normally, I am proud to say \"I love Target!\" but not today, you have successfully lost a long-time loyal customer.

Putting a cute whale in the design doesn't take away from the fact that they're stiffer and more cheaply made.

I'm grateful to not have encountered anything... But maybe walking right into the palm beach post will help as well... No one will take this seriously until the unspeakable happens.... SMH !! Corporate target needs to know that one of their locations is not concerned for the safety of their customers. PBSO needs to take more concern into this... A sketch & a story on the news is LOOOOOOOONG OVERDUE.... A sketch of this man/ men need to be at the entrance & checkout counters of ALL TARGETS in the area.....

I could have used Amazon, as my instincts told me to, but stuck with Target due to my REDCard's 5% off and my general love for your company.\n\nToday I recieved an email, without warning, that my order had been cancelled due to card-related problems. What were the problems? Why, the fact that my card number changed after YOUR company voluntarily \"upgraded\" my card to a MasterCard. Yes, the free upgrade that I did not initiate managed to prevent my charge from going through. And unlike Amazon who will email you an alert when a problem occurs and allow you to FIX the problem without cancelling your order, your system instantly cancelled it. The only consolation offered? Telling me I could just \"reorder\" the items. Except the 40% off promotion under which I initially did so ended a month ago.\n\nWhen I reached out to chat support I was offered \"the maximum price match possible for an expired promotion\" of 20% off. Hardly a reasonable solution for an error that wasn't mine. After much pushing the offer was upped to 30%. And while that's progress, it's still unacceptable on principle. I passed up 40% off from an alternate retailer who would have honored my original agreement with them even if *I* had been at fault for an error with my credit card to do business with you for a specific final total and, instead, I'm being shafted.\n\nThis procedure you have in place where any card error means instant cancellation, especially on a preorder, is completely unreasonable. Please fix that for your future customers. In the meantime, if this is the best resolution you can offer me, 5% off is no longer worth me rolling the dice with your company over Amazon who I know honors their purchase agreements. I will keep the order canceled, my kids and I will remain disappointed, and I will wait until these go on sale again at a competitor.",

I know there are horrible people everywhere, but I consider target to be a company that cares about how it's customers feel when shopping there. Please don't disappoint us.",

When I got home I opened the bag and noticed the comforter was ripped and stained. So today after my daughter napped I went to the store to exchange the comforter. When I tried to explain what happened, I was told this comforter was used and she walked away with the item. About 2 minutes later a man returned name carl with my items. I had the original packaging and the receipt in hand. He told me \"you must be confused. This was NOT the item you purchased yesterday\". I proceeded to tell him it was. He proceeded to get ruder and louder. To the point where he told me I needed to leave the store. I was given a number to call guest relations. I walked shaking back to my car. All of this happened while I was holding my toddler. I calmed down before I could drive. I drove home and called guest relations. They told me I could in fact exchange it. They gave me a reference number. I returned to the store with my husband. When I arrived the police came in the store. How embarrassing! Over a $22 comforter. I was then told I had to get a gift card, and was told that I was confused and there was NO way this could be the correct item. When in fact it was. I have all my receipts and packaging. The fact that your company allows employees to treat customers this way is not ok . ESPECIALLY the fact he was a male employee and I had my child with me. It's completely unprofessional.",

Things just aren't the same between you and I, and much like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt I think it might be time I divorce you. To be honest it's not you it's me, well and one of your employees. There's a particular lady at my local Target in mentor Ohio who is just always grumpy. She has a permanent scowl on her face , and I suspect her heart is black instead of the beautiful Target red. Most recently I encountered her because of some trouble I was having with the self-checkout, and she works in customer service. She came over to help, but with her elitist, grumpy attitude. After very arrogantly pointing coupon out fine print to a coupon that was different than the one I was trying to use she left me standing there with a substantial amount of items that she insisted I could not purchase as planned. Feeling very confused , I decided I would hold off on my purchase until I could better understand what she was talking about. but she had already stormed away leaving me with my special needs toddler who was half asleep slumped over the cart on my arm. I ended up having to go back into the store myself to put everything away , as I did not want to just leave it for the next person to deal with. Although this is not my only encounter with her, where I walked away less than pleased with her customer service skills this was the worst. And so I think time for a trial separation. I usually visit you no less than 4 times a week , the ladies at the Starbucks counter make my coffee perfectly every time and have always been amazing especially with my son. I'm sure at some point we will reconcile but for now I will be making my coffee at home and shopping on Amazon. At least that way if there's a price discrepancy once I get something in my cart it's just a few clicks for me to put stuff back.",

I ordered a Shark Handheld vacuum to be delivered to my home because it was on sale and they didn't have it in the store.  That was August 23rd.  It is now 9/20 and I have not received my item but I have received 5 delay emails.  The only problem I have with the delay is the fact that they have the item stocked in stores for people who are willing to pay more than the sale price.  So I called customer service and spoke to a representative who could only tell me what my expected delivery date is.  So I had to speak to a manager.  The manager offered me 10% off because of the delay.  I told him I didn't mind the delay and didn't want the percent off, I wanted the product considering my local target had them in stock and they couldn't guarantee that it would be delivered by the next expected date.  He told me there was nothing he could do.  I asked him to cancel my order. He told me that wouldn't be possible because it was already processed. So basically I am a prisoner to target.  They have my money, but won't let me have the product.  They tell me that it's because of the warehouse.  I advised them I would be cancel all my cards and never shopping at target again.  This exact thing happened a year ago when I ordered a kuerig machine.  The machine was on sale in the store an sold out, I ordered it online, it kept getting delayed for over a month but they had them in the store once the sale ended.  When I called last time they cancelled my order, ordered it for me online to pick up in the store at the discounted price AND gave me a gift card for the trouble.  That's back when the call center was in the US, it is not now.  Target only screws people that order things on sale and make sure that people who are willing to pay more have the item available to them. I buy most of my home items as well as both my son's diapers with target. Not anymore I'm done with target.",

I received an email asking me to accept the new shipping date for the gift cards connected to the preordered movie. The link did not work however, so I called customer service and he assured me that he had confirmed the gift cards delivery dates. I then get an e-mail that the gift cards were cancelled. I call customer service and after being escalated, I am told that I need to manually cancel my order of 4 movies and then re-order all of them. I cancelled the order and re-order then get the exact same email for the new order today. I called and (after escalation again), I am told that there really isn't anything they can do. How is it possible that a customer service representative can not accept a new ship date or provide a $5 discount on the order since the GC is cancelled (despite the customer doing everything possible to get the new shipping date entered.) I am shocked and will be cancelling all of my pre-ordered movies (about 15). You've lost a customer and redcard holder over $20 (and the hour and a half over 3 diff calls to customer service). I'd be happy to provide my order number via email if you are hiding any IT geniuses that can fix my target.com order.",

Said Matthew McClintock of Barclays. For Target to achieve its longer-term target of 3% comps, it is essential for the company to reverse the current traffic trends, noted McClintock. He added, however that the transaction with CVS was unlikely to be a significant traffic driver for Target. \n\nAHHHH missing a million and a half previous shoppers might have something to do with it, don't ya think???",

If you answered yes, PLEASE READ!  This is not a chain/spam/copy and paste thing, it's totally me, Kristina typing this, although I don't mind at all if you DO share!!!  \n\nI would STRONGLY ADVISE against shopping at Target for any reason.  THEY WILL NOT, I repeat NOT refund your money or replace your item if THEIR security is breached.  It's \"not their policy\".  \n\nI purchased a $50 virtual gift card at Target.com for Keisha Hufford to be sent directly to her cell number.  I did so from my home, right here in Illinois. Convenient eh?  Sure!  It popped right up on her phone that very hour, and the money was debited from my account.  She then took the card to her local Target store, right here in good old Illinois, and attempted to purchase something with it.  She was told that it was \"empty\" because it had been redeemed in CALIFORNIA.  After over an hour of in-store hassle and phone calling to Target.com, she was promised a fresh new gift card to be mailed to her.  \n\nNo such luck!  Today she called to check the status and was told that her \"case was denied\".  They said again that the gift card was redeemed at a Target in California,  in order to purchase...wait for it...more gift cards.  That doesn't sound scammy at all, does it?  >:-(\n\nFrustrated and EMBARRASSED at how my \"gift\" to her was turning out, I called them myself today.  Another hour wasted. Spoke with several \"gift card specialists\" who confirmed that it is not Target's policy to replace stolen virtual gift cards, even though they ADMITTED it was a security breach on their end!  \n\nI called my bank this afternoon and they can not dispute the charges because it was an authorized transaction; AND AND AND...wait for it...according to my bank, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WITH TARGET.  \n\nMoral of the story my friends:  TARGET is a corrupt and morally bankrupt company in literally every sense.  From twisted, liberal social policies to corruption at the financial level, they are just BAD.  You'll not find me there again; and I hope that this post makes it to enough people to make AT LEAST a $50 dent in their profit margin!!!!  If I can't have my money back, and Keisha can't have her gift card replaced, then TARGET shouldn't get the money either!!!!!  \n\nFeel free to share.

I was not aware that target checks your account balance every week on preorders. I have preordered from different companies online and have never experienced that on preorders.

I gave a call to customer service and they let me know that they wouldn't be able to send a replacement (despite the fact that it was an online order), but that I would need to go into the closest store to address the issue with them. I guess that's what I'll have to do, but it's really kind of a disappointment that I'm now going to have to take an hour out of my already busy schedule to try to drive to a Target store, re-explain the situation, and fight for a replacement for sheets that are a month and a half old.

If you answered yes, PLEASE READ! This is not a chain/spam/copy and paste thing, it's totally me, Kristina typing this, although I don't mind at all if you DO share!!!\nI would STRONGLY ADVISE against shopping at Target for any reason. THEY WILL NOT, I repeat NOT refund your money or replace your item if THEIR security is breached. It's \"not their policy\".\nI purchased a $50 virtual gift card at Target.com for Keisha Hufford to be sent directly to her cell number. I did so from my home, right here in Illinois. Convenient eh? Sure! It popped right up on her phone that very hour, and the money was debited from my account. She then took the card to her local Target store, right here in good old Illinois, and attempted to purchase something with it. She was told that it was \"empty\" because it had been redeemed in CALIFORNIA. After over an hour of in-store hassle and phone calling to Target.com, she was promised a fresh new gift card to be mailed to her.\nNo such luck! Today she called to check the status and was told that her \"case was denied\". They said again that the gift card was redeemed at a Target in California, in order to purchase...wait for it...more gift cards. That doesn't sound scammy at all, does it? >:-(\nFrustrated and EMBARRASSED at how my \"gift\" to her was turning out, I called them myself today. Another hour wasted. Spoke with several \"gift card specialists\" who confirmed that it is not Target's policy to replace stolen virtual gift cards, even though they ADMITTED it was a security breach on their end!\nI called my bank this afternoon and they can not dispute the charges because it was an authorized transaction; AND AND AND...wait for it...according to my bank, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WITH TARGET.\nMoral of the story my friends: TARGET is a corrupt and morally bankrupt company in literally every sense. From twisted, liberal social policies to corruption at the financial level, they are just BAD. You'll not find me there again; and I hope that this post makes it to enough people to make AT LEAST a $50 dent in their profit margin!!!! If I can't have my money back, and Keisha can't have her gift card replaced, then TARGET shouldn't get the money either!!!!!\nFeel free to share.

While walking thru the little boys section, I came across a t shirt that I thought my seven year old daughter would like. I sorted thru the shirts and determined that a M would be best. A little while later I found a t shirt in the little girls section that I thought she would also like. Since I usually buy her girls clothes, I knew that a large would be the right option. I compared the shirt sizes in the store to make sure they were roughly the same size, and they were. When I got home, however, I noticed that the boys medium was larger, considerably. By almost 2.5 inches! That's an almost 5 inches around!\nHow does it make sense that a boys medium would be larger than a girls large? We are talking about children's bodies, which at this point (my daughter is 7), are basically the same shape. I know that this isn't the first time sizing has been brought to your attention, and I wanted to make sure you realize this is still an issue. As a women I can tell you for a fact that at your stores I buy for myself large in women's clothing, but I have purchased men's small sized shirts for myself. This is confusing and insulting. Is a human woman's body expected to be smaller than a man's human body? Throughout one's life? At the rate my daughter is growing, I won't be able to shop for her in the little girls section much longer. How I will explain to an 8/9 year old that she can't fit into the clothes THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR HER AGE GROUP but not her actual body size? I shouldn't have divulge her height and weight for you to decide whether or not my argument is valid. An average 7 year old should be able to be dressed in clothing labeled for little girls.",

Per the store, the item has been discontinued and no rain checks will be given. Per Target.com, the item is due to be restocked and is not discontinued, but target.com does not offer rain checks either.\n\nI called Target.com customer service 4 times yesterday, and hung up the first 3 times due to not being able to understand the representative due to a heavy accent. Target should really consider relocating customer service back to the United States. This will prevent upset or dissatisfied customers, as those over sea's are just reading a script and lack common sense on how to truly resolve an issue. \n\nMeanwhile, here Target advertises an item, but has absolutely none available, and refuses to check stores throughout the country to see if one may have an item available. I'm fully and willing to pay for shipping of the item(Does this not show that it is an awesome sale deal??). \n\nI know other retailers have this item available available instore and online, however I do have gift cards available for Target, and would like to be able to utilize them. \n\nHopefully someone will help so I can still be a valued Target Shopper!",

I had an item show up on a baby registry I printed out as $8.99. It rang up as $10.19. I showed the price to the cashier who informed me \"We don't price match,\" (Wrong: they do. Learn your policy, please). I asked her to adjust the price that THIS store advertised as a sale item. She informed me I needed to go to Guest Svcs for that. I was like, \"Why should I have to walk to another location to be charged the price you advertised for this item?\" I asked her if she could do a price override at this register, could she get a mgr to approve it? In 2 seconds, she entered the override, charging me the sale price. But not without a tone in her voice, conveying her displeasure that I asked her to do her job, instead of pushing me off on Guest Svcs. She kept answering my comments with \"yes ma'm\" but her tone was incongruent with her words. All she had to do was put herself in my shoes. Would she want to run all over the store to be charged the correct price for an item? Doubtful. So why the attitude? Came home and read the Target Policy, to learn they DO price match and that the policy requires \"guests\" (shoppers) to visit Guest Services to get any price adjustments. Bad customer service, Target! Change your policy. Doubtful if I will be doing business with Target in the future. Only went there because a sweet woman I love selected their baby registry.

We had about $100 worth of items and upon arrival to the check Lanes we noticed there were approximately 10 to 15 customers being serviced at only two registers. \n\nMy mother walked up to customer service at that point where there were four employees and one customer service agent not servicing any customers. We asked if we could check out there as the lines at the to check lines were very long. She proceeded to check us out promptly, but while we were standing there the one of the four Associates, there when we walked up, pulled out her feet and begin to lotion them, at the customer service counter in plain view of customers and other associates. My husband was with us and made a comment that he couldn't believe an associate would pull their feet out in front of customers and just lotion them as if it were normal behavior. I made a comment that it was a bit strange and the associate checking us out, commented that she didn't think that was weird at all. And asked me why did I think it was a problem and what was wrong with it. I explained to her that if I had to tell her what was wrong with it she probably would not understand. \n\nI like the location, it's one of the few Super Targets left. I love the clearance selection, but while we were there we weren't assisted on the sales floor at all. We are looking at a new swing for our baby that didn't appear to be in stock, but managed to find it on our own. I actually bragged to my mother about the location and was really disappointed in the overall cleanliness and organization of the store, the availability of the team members there, as well as the young lady that checked us out. There was not much of a selection in the baby department and I hate to spend my money at Walmart.",

We are a one income family with a toddler and baby two due in Nov so sometimes we choose other stores closer to save money. If I could get on a mailing list I am certain I would shop target more. The closest one is 40 minutes away. I have my baby registery with Target and plan to do the same with any future children. I have recently just saw a few friends post about coupons in the mail and I have never received any. I very much would like to know what to do. Thank you",

Has shows such as paw patrol, Peppa pig, shimmer and shine and many more shows. My son goes to day care where, there happens to be more girls than boys so granted there are \"girl toys\" around. One of the little girls just recently got a new peppa pig set of toys. My son wanted one too.. He has been talking about getting peppa pig toys for the last two days. Tonight my fiancé and I decided to go to target to buy his toy along with some other need household goods. We went to the target in Pasadena Ca on the corner of Colorado and Sunnyslope. While there we were looking though the toy section looking for some type of peppa pig toy and they had nothing. Not one peppa pig toy! So we told my son to pick something else. He chose a set of shimmer and shine dolls. We continued to shop (which during the whole time my son was so excited about his shimmer and shine dolls)and when we were done we went to check out! When we were checking out the cashier who's name was crystal felt the need to ask me if the dolls were for my son. When I said yes she made the ugliest facial expression and said \"oh no, you can't buy him dolls he is a boy. Dolls are for girls. Why are u buying him those.\" I couldn't believe what she said. I told her that's what my son wanted so in buying him those dolls. At that point my son began to cry. He was so upset that she said those dolls weren't for him. She looked at me and said \"oh no\" and proceeded to ring me up for the rest of the items. I remained calmed finished checking out and my fiancé took my son to the car while I waited to speak to her supervisor. His name was Juan. I explained to him what happened and I expressed to him how unprofessional, inappropriate, and down right absurd it was for this employee to tell me that I can't buy my three year old son a set of dolls. The supervisor who was of no help at all offered me a gift card so that I may buy a drink from Starbucks and \"cool off\"\n\nI jut can't believe this whole experience. It was my understanding that target was very  accepting and non-discriminatory. I just can't believe this. I am so upset. It it no ones business what I chose to buy nut son or not buy my son. I chose to not subject my toddler to today's society's gender discrimination. Who says boys can't play with dolls!! That target employee had no right telling me I cannot buy my son the toy he wants because \"it's for girls\"!! And how dare she make my son cry..  I don't even know what else to say... Just please like and share this post this is absolutely unacceptable and it needs to stop!!!",

Very disappointing that Target sees fit to poke fun at people with mental illness\n\nDear Target, I have a problem with you right now. I was just casually meandering through your clothing just now and I stumbled upon this shirt... And I went from 0 to furious in about six seconds. You see, I have been struggling with bulimia nervosa, an illness known for binging and purging, for the majority of the past six years. And boy have they been fun years: damage of an unknown degree to bones/ joints/ and my reproductive systems, as well as lesions in my esophagus ( which means that I've thrown up my fair share of blood) and contributing to this arrhythmia in my heart. So excuse me if I don't find this \"funny\" Target. Maybe  you should consider the fact that your shoppers might be struggling with serious mental illnesses and take the damn shirt down.",

I know that containers need to be washed, etc, but I often see nothing in the sink and the water is still on with a strong stream flowing down the drain. I was recently there during a busy time and saw the water running full blast for 15 minutes, with no attention from an employee. Clean water is such a precious resource and I know Starbucks can do a better job preserving it without make much effort at all. Thank you.",

Recently our school has been in the news for changing our homework policy.  Our focus is instead of the typical homework we want families to engage with their children with board games, art and movement.  We are a high poverty school with 75% of our students living below the poverty line with over 30 different languages spoken.  Therefore, I am asking if Target would be open to donating games, art supplies or items to increase physical activity to our 600 students.  We are going to be filmed next week for a national network news program and thought it would be cool if Target could be highlighted donating games and other items to promote family engagement.  I'd be happy to give details and exchange information if you would like to talk further.  Thanks for your consideration.",

            "message": "To whomever reads this comment,\n\n      I love your store in Port Charlotte Florida. Its an older Target. It's not a \"Super Target\", but it's our Target. My family and I (up until this weekend) have kind of a ritual that has been a part of our lives since before my daughter could walk, and we just celebrated her 6th birthday last week. It happens every Saturday or Sunday morning after walking past the big red balls into the front doors we shoot right to the Dollarspot while we wait for coffee from Starbucks. After getting the \"$10 chocolate milks\" as they have been affectionately nicknamed in our family, we make our way around the outside of the entire store. Through women's clothing, pass through children's shoes, a brief stop in the men's section to look at T-shirts, before landing in what has become the heart of our experience. My wife and I usually take our daughter through the toy isles and let her pick something out. Something small not more than like $10-$20, you know depending on her behavior the previous week at school and while shes in the store. Then back through electronics, through the seasonal items, then grocery for a few things health and beauty for a few things, through the pet are and finally back at the registers where we pay for our items with our red card, and the whole reason for this comment.\n\n     Now I'm not one to typically put my business out there, but after talking to multiple customer support associates, and talking to an \"on duty supervisor (Donna from Arizona) over the phone I have gotten no where with an issue that I along with countless online reviews believe needs to be addressed.\n\n    Now I am a faithful user of my Target Red Card I love the 5% off perk and the option to pay it at the end of the month without incurring any fees is what I look for in a great Dept Store Credit Card. Now on the 1st Saturday or Sunday of the month. I have set up my auto pay on said Target Red Card to pay my minimum payment directly from my bank account IF DUE. This is for situations that may arise and I don't make it to the counter before my due date. Though this specific instance I did however make a payment at the counter before the due date. Not only did i make a payment but I had recently changed banks and wanted to make sure everything was correct with my auto payment. So I set a payment to draft and was not given any failure prompts. Also it was on this day that my \"auto\" payment was due, but the week prior to this I had made a desk payment which would mean there shouldn't have been a minimum balance due for this billing cycle. After realizing that my payment hadn't gone through because of an error of transposing two numbers in the new account info I quickly went in and paid the full balance to ensure there would be no issues with my card i would hate for some minor confusion to cause a wrinkle in what had been an otherwise perfect credit relationship over all these years.\n\n     It wasn't until two weeks later when I received a letter saying my account had been closed for \"NON PAYMENT\" that I began this trip in what has now  turned from confusion to anger. I did what every responsible person would do I immediately called Target Red Card Services and it was explained again the account had been closed due to non payment. I explained that it was impossible to close an account due to non payment when I had made my payment at the desk. i was then informed that \" it is Target Policy if there are two consecutive returned payments the account is closed and sent to collections, no exceptions.\" I again tried to explain there shouldn't have been a second payment made. The payment made at the desk was sufficient yet policy says they have to close my account? I then tried to convey both \"returned payments\" were made within hours of each other. I understand if you had two returned payments within a 3 month period but for them to be in the same day I would expect there to be some concessions made. It was then I was put on a brief ( 21 minute ) hold and was connected to a Supervisor. Ms Donna from Arizona, though very managerial in tone she didn't seem too concerned with the honest mistake, the confusion or the simple math of the matter. She only drove home target policy.  \"it is Target Policy if there are two consecutive returned payments the account is closed and sent to collections, no exceptions.\" After I explained that it was a new bank account and there was some confusion in the numbers being transposed Ms Donna from Arizona's tone changed. Then there was an exception that could be made if I could get the bank to take responsibility for the confusion. I again tried to explain to Ms Donna from Arizona that it really shouldn't matter because the second payment on their end should have never been drafted due to the desk payment and if there were no previous exceptions to be made of the policy why now that there was a bank involved have things changed? \n\n    In a strange twist there was silence on the other end of the line. No response from the on duty supervisor. I responded to the silence by saying I could talk to my bank but I don't see why that should make a difference if the error of the second draft. Again, just silence. Then the familiar tone of an apple device call ending.\n\n    That's the whole thing from start to finish. After talking to my wife we've decided that if a company that we've frequented for so long thinks so little of our patronage that they can not use their best judgement and see that the acts were not malicious or the account was not delinquent before not only closing an active upstanding account but to attempt to poorly effect my credit by turning in a false \"Non Payment\" to a credit bureau. This is a company we will no longer be spending our hard earned money and I will make sure to pass this info on to my family and friends so they can make an educated decision for themselves.\n\n   \nThank you for your time \nKris Sadler\nNorth Port Florida",

My 8 year old son has autism and, like many autistic children, finding just the right clothes that feel just right can be a challenge due to sensory issues.  My son is particularly sensitive about pants.  Denim is \"too stiff\" while the button and zipper requires too much dexterity.  In his perfect world, sweat pants would be acceptable attire in every setting (the kid might be on to something).  Thankfully, Target answered our prayers with these Cat & Jack pants.  If you have a boy who struggles with sensory issues and pants, look no further than Target.  I found these little gems at Target today for $16.99/pair.  They look like jeans but have a super-soft cotton lining on the inside that feels like sweatpants.  These are three of the five pairs I purchased, but there are many to choose from.  ❤️",

The customer service manager had a terrible attitude and basically told us tough luck.

I asked how this program worked and what coupons were acceptable and the LOD said he didn't know.  My coupon expires today so not only am I out my free item but from here on out I will have to consider whether I want to shop for deals at Target.

Despite the efforts of Katy and Anna, I had my last straw today with a cashier whose callous attitude escalated me into a tirade at Customer Service where I got typical excuses and no resolution as is typical for this store ultimately reinforcing my decision to NEVER do business with this store again! Essentially told by the cashier that I did not receive my Cartwheel by Target discount because I had made a mistake despite showing her that I very clearly had not. And surprise! When complaining at CS they discovered I was right and only made excuses for the cashier. The MOD Nathan knew me as he was involved with another incident of stupidity with employees in the DVD department a few weeks back that again was customer service at its worst involving an advertised item that was also on the Cartwheel app no being readily available because (they were going through some changes in that department) and made an effort to provide me something that should have been on the shelf already but people were to 'overwhelmed'? to do their their jobs. They lost another sale from me inquiring about the availability of the new Britney CD since it wasn't in the flyer and after 2 hangups and being on hold for 15 minutes the employee had no idea. 2 minute call to Best Buy and I got an answer. Called again to check on the availability of another item and reached an operator who told me she could not help me because she 'didn't know how to transfer calls'. Seriously! This is the person you put on your switchboard? Add in regular items constantly being out of stock due to (we're a lower volume store so we just don't carry everything even though we do have a slot for that product that's actually sitting in the back room but no one has put it out) I've dealt with Katy numerous times and she has provided exceptional customer service and was the ONLY reason I still did business with this store but in truth I should NOT have to talk to a manager every time I have a question about a product. At this point, only in the case of it being something that I can only get at Target will I do business with this company and it will definitely NOT be the Taunton location. Someone really needs to wake up and take a hard look at what's going on the stores because we all have choices as to where to spend our hard earned money and be treated like valued, loyal customers. After the lack of concern by anyone but Katy and Anna at Target, my choices are clearly Best Buy and Walmart Raynham! They treat people like they matter and would NEVER let problems escalate! Also, I'm not just throwing around store names. Due to the fiasco with the DVD new release last month I have taken my TV new release business exclusively to Best Buy. That business has amounted to $700 in the past 5 weeks and there are still 4 more weeks of releases to come. THAT'S what Target Taunton has lost!",

I swear, every time I visit your store, I get lost in the labrynthine aisles of chenille throws, fox-embroidered pillows, and wall decor. I tried to take a nap once there but I was caught and the Target employee did not allow me to take the blue half-pillow that I was clutching despite my cries that I \"can't go cold turkey.\" I have asked my employer to pay me in Target gift cards so I can buy more fleece blankets and two-sided comforters with geometric embroideries, but since I'm a teacher, that's really only two $25 cards a month. I feel that the Sisyphusian task of gaining all varieties of Target pillows is even tougher than Pokemon GO (collect them all?) but at least this mountain is soft. So Target - please make uglier things. Because very soon I will have no home other than a spectacularly adorable pillow fort.",

My sister had the worst experience, yesterday was her bridal shower and she received multiples of the same items that were on her registry that said they were still available to buy online. Here our family thought they were buying my sister a special gift she needed when all of my family bought the same items. Now she has multiple gifts she needs to go out of her way to return and will not get anything compensated for this ordeal. She talked to a supervisor from Minneapolis that told her, her family members at the store had to tell the cashier to scan the barcode for the item to go from available to unavailable online and that we will only be receiving store credit. The multiple cashiers my family members went through to buy registry items were incompetent on this aspect of their job. This registry has turned into a nightmare.",

I hadn't been in for awhile and went one day and it looked like disaster struck, what a mess. I realized it was day before school started, was crazy busy so dismissed it. We went back a couple weeks later and my friend's first words were \"this place is a mess\". Again there was trash and debris all over the carpet in entry, floors dirty, junk piled all over customer service area (counters, pallets or stacks of merchandise), dirty floors going to dirty bathrooms, carts all about, all the cheap impulse merchandise display in entry area was a mess, mess and dirty are really the only ways to describe it. One employee standing near the self checkout perhaps for help but doing nothing (I hate self checkout. It puts people out of jobs. I was disappointed to see it and won't use it). Since the \"remodel\" it's just a trashy place to shop. This is how bad it is - it makes Walmart look not so abhorrent. I do not shop there but have had to go in as a favor to help a friend and - Walmart looked even better than this dump.",

Target's policy has now resulted in at least two separate sexual violations on women in Texas stores. The latest was just last week, when a man used his cell phone to video a woman in a changing room in a Dallas Target store.\n\nIn response, Attorney General Ken Paxton again reached out to Target, saying, \"After this latest incident, I hope Target finally recognizes the importance of protecting its customers, especially in environments where they can be at their most vulnerable. I am offering them the resources of my office to help assist them in improving their safety procedures.\"",

And confirming that the store did in fact have the doll, I again drove an hour from my home to purchase the doll. All I wanted to do was purchase this doll for my daughter who's name happens to be Katelyn. If you can assist me with this, please let me know.

            "message": "I am so disappointed in Target for changing their UP & UP Wipes. My baby was born in April 2016. When she was born all of the other wipes on the market chewed up my daughter's poor little butt, especially Pampers! We had tried a whole bunch of different ones, and settled on Target Brand wipes in the Purple Color. We loved how clean and simple they were, they didn't chew up her little butt(in fact I'd go as far as to say it helped clear up her butt combined with Triple Paste), and they gripped the poo as we wiped. These wipes were so good we felt confident foregoing the ointment regiment completely. These wipes were a fabulous product! The key word being \"WERE\"! I don't know why Target had to go and mess with a perfect product. They made them more cloth like, and now they aren't as pliable, and they don't grip the poo when we wipe. We go through twice as many wipes in each poopy diaper, simply because they no longer get the job done efficiently. We were so disappointed in this product with the new face. We had been so confident in the product before, so we bought a case of them in August, even though they had changed. That's one mistake I'll never make again with any product! The first wipe we used out of the new packaging made us immediately regret our purchase! Because of this rude awakening, the next time any product that I usually buy in bulk changes, I'll buy a small package of the new face to test before entrusting in the product I've come to know and love. After we painstakingly got through the case of these wipes, we had to begin our search for the perfect wipe all over again. For any of you other moms out there in the same boat as me(and I know there are a ton of you out there), we settled on \"honest wipes\". They are great! They are exactly like the Target wipes before they decided to changed their fabulous product. I honestly wasn't paying attention to the price though, so I can't tell you what the comparative cost is, but the product comparison is an even match to the original Target Wipes. Please Target....bring back the original wipes! These new ones are awful! Why, oh why, did you mess with an already PERFECT product?!",

She said she would only give us $14. We thought that was poor customer service, but went with it. What she said next is the shocker. She promptly said that the item was clearance and that they would be THROWING THE TOY AWAY! Is it a common practice for Target Inc to engage in such wasteful practices? If the toy is not popular, one could at the very least donate the toy to any of the numerous organizations who support low income families. Truly disheartened at this information.",

I went back to my car for the receipt which took me a maximum of 3 mins to do. Upon return my return there were tow persons ahead of me and then Ms Peralto was open to handle my return. Unbelievably knowing I was online before she stepped out of the Guest Relations leaving me stranded,  I asked her \"really are you going to walk away just like this?\" Her response is I don't work in this area the other attendee would deal with you, who incidentally was already dealing with other customer.

This week I decided to try ordering two items online from Target for the first time. When I checked out I was awarded a $5 gift card as a promotional event. Sounded OK to me! I never asked for it; it was just offered. Next day I get an email saying that the delivery date of the card had to be postponed a couple of days (no problem...), but it went on to say \"If we don't hear from you, your item(s) will be canceled.\" Thinking this a little odd, I went to the Target website to approve the new delivery date. No problem. Except that there was virtually NO WAY to approve the new date. Isn't that convenient (for them)! So I called. No problem. The service rep said he'd take care of it and approve it for me. Today I looked at my bank account and see that I have been charged $5 for a promotional gift card. I call again. The explanation given was that the two products I had ordered were discounted $5 so I would be charged $5 for the card I never requested in the first place. The guy said he would refund the $5 dollars and hoped that I understood how much they value me as a customer. SERIOUSLY??????\nI'm waiting to see if the $5 is actually refunded, but in the meantime, I will NEVER darken the doors of either their physical or virtual store again.\nUnbelievable!\nYou would think that with all the publicity they had a couple of years ago with hacking of their credit card system they would try to improve their methods of doing business. Apparently they are just moving on to new methods.\nWhat a sucky store.",

I spent over $50 and you can't give me $5 off? And why make someone call a number to find this out? Why not just let the store employees pass this info along, or better yet post a sign for people BEFORE they get to the checkout. If I'm already irritated that my coupon won't work, I'm really upset by the time I have to call an 800 number twice because it wouldn't work the first time around. Target, I am a frequent visitor and a Red Card holder, but I have had issues with coupons at your store time and time again. I'm nearly to the point where I just won't shop with you anymore.",

Afterwards I looked at your policy and it does not state this.

Well, it turned out to be a nightmare and I left your store sobbing. I tried to sign on to the iPad looking things to start my registry, I had to sign on to my target.com account in order to have a registry. I forgot my password, so I submitted a password change. I waited and waited for the email link to change it. Nothing, I went to the guest relations where a sweet girl jasmine was working, she provided me the phone number to call for a change, well it routed me to India( must be where your call center is located). I then struggled to understand the Represenative and had to repeat my email address 4-5 times where he said it would take 30 mins for me to receive another password, so I shopped your store waiting for my password. 30 minutes went by no e-mail. I Called the number provided, and once again routed to India, a Represenative reset my password resending the link, I asked her if I could delete my account and restart a new one, she said no, I asked to speak to someone else as I so wanted to complete my registry today and I'd already been in the store for an hour and a half waiting for an e-mail that still has not come. I waited on hold about 10 minutes to speak with another woman from India who tried to delete my account but cannot re-sign me back up for one because I have the same e-mail address. So, I cannot complete a registry at Target unless I create a new e-mail account. Everyone pretty much told me.... Sorry, too bad. \n\nMoral to story- I will never step foot back in a Target again. You have completely lost my family's business. If you keep treating your customers like this you will be the next KMart soon. Best of luck.

It was shocking! I can't see spending my money in a filthy, nasty, dangerous store. \n.",

Had it all pulled up on my phone to show the employee (I've done this a handful of times before so I thought I knew the drill). Once I told her I wanted a price match she goes and grabs her tablet to look it up, no problem I thought she'll see the same one I'm looking at and take care of the price match and I'd be on my way. WRONG. Target in store price is $49.99, Amazon price is $30.39, the one the employee found on Amazon was $44.99. I showed her my phone to let her know that it is in fact cheaper on Amazon. She just kinda shrugged her shoulders and said she needed to go by her tablet price. I asked her how she searched for it and she gave me some line of oh I find it on the target website then hit the little Amazon button and this is what comes up....Ok, cool? I asked her to type in the name of the product and search it because at this point she's only showing one result, she shrugs again and claims she doesn't know how to do that! I'm frustrated at this point, holding a sick baby that has now thrown up on me and your counter. I ask to see a manager, the 'team lead' leans over (in the middle orf trying to help another customer) and says oh we don't price match to Amazon Prime (I was signed into my Prime account). Ok fine I didn't know the fine print to your price matching policy. I'm irritated by how both of your employees spoke down to me and were unwilling to help. This is what I'd expect from Walmart, not Target. I ended up leaving the rest of the items in my cart and left. \n\nGot out to my car and called your 800 number for customer experience, that woman was just as unhelpful. She called the store, spoke to the team lead and got back on to tell me you don't price match to Prime. Ok thanks lady we've already established that! I want those two employees spoken to by a manager and told that they are at the guest services counter to help and not belittle me! \n\nI signed out of Prime and guess what I found?? The SAME EXACT PRICE (see photo). Is there now any reason you won't price match to this?! I'm going to go back up there today and skip the dumb employees at the desk and speak to a manager...we'll see how it goes and how I'm treated today! \n\nMight be my last shopping trip to Target!",

I earned enough points to qualify for a perk and selected the perk I wanted on the Cartwheel app, but I'm not sure how to actually get the perk.  I chose the product I wanted when prompted by the Cartwheel app, found the product on the shelf in the store, and put the product in my actual shopping cart, but when I checked out in the store, I was still charged for the product.  I am not clear if I will receive a coupon for the free item, if the free item is supposed to automatically be added (once I select it) to my Cartwheel barcode, or if the perk is redeemed in some other way.

            "message": "I am beyond fed up of Target. It seems every time I go, I always have a negative experience. About a week and a half ago, my fiancé and I decided to go into the target because I needed a baby seat cover for the shopping carts, and everywhere I went they were either not there, or not in stock. It got to the point of not wanting to wait any longer and wait a few weeks for one to be shipped, so we decided to check target. They only had two of them as options, but they had it, so I decided to get it. Since we were there and I always look at things for my infant, we also decided to get a few items. We went to the self check out since we only had 3 items and all the lines were long. I went through the process of scanning everything and I put my card in for the chip to finalize the purchase. I accidentally hit the change payment option and it prompted me that it couldn't, which was fine because I did it on accident and it was already going through anyway. The lady came up to the register and kept pressing buttons when I told her it was fine, it took the payment already. Since she kept messing with it, it froze up the register. She then told me that she would ring me up on the other register. I asked why when the payment went through and she told me that the payment doesn't go through until the receipt comes out and since it didn't, it didn't work. I specifically asked a few times and made it clear that since it's my bank card, is she sure that it wouldn't go through numerous times and she told me she was certain. Then sure enough after I left, I check my bank and it took it out of my account twice. My total was about $57 dollars for only a few items, and when we are a family of one working, since day care is too expensive and we get absolutely no other help, $57 is a lot of money when you have children, which I why I kept asking. When I noticed I went back in right away and talked with the manager. He told me how he voided it out himself when he reset that register and how it should go back on my card in 1-2 days. I made it clear I was not happy because that is a lot of money when I was already annoyed that it told me it went through before the register froze, and this employee told me she has worked there long enough and knows that it won't without a receipt, which is complete bullshit obviously since because of her I got charged twice!! Well sure enough it is a week and a half later and the issue has still not been resolved. The money was never refunded and all they keep saying is it will be resolved, yet it hasn't. All because of their mistake and this manager not wanting to do his damn job but talk to another employee, who said he fixed it, clearly did not either. This is unacceptable and ridiculous. Issues like this could cause someone to overdraft and then have way more fee's, since not everyone has a lot of money all the time. I am definitely at the point of never wanting to shop at Target, when they won't even fix their mistake.",

Right side of history: ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY for living forever with technology by announcing \"dead=bad\" calendar \"Bad Friday\" calendar until calendar-companies catch up, rather than stealthysneakybloodyshredhumansGood Friday (calendar-flaw mere decades old).\n\nAmericans have been talked into their thinking less of fellow Americans, RATHER THAN being talked into \"dealmaking\" with the same fellow Americans. Meanwhile, \"tempting dealmaking,\" at talking with a foreign hostile the same way, also isn't tempting \"dealmaking\" either. TEMPTATION. TEMPTATION. WHERE IS THE TEMPTATION. TEMPTATION REQUIRES \"knowing your neighbor\" RATHER THAN THE SOLITUDE OF \"agree to disagree.\"\n\nResurrect them both (resurrect Jesus, resurrect your King David, too, rapture them both, got any dusty blood or somethingsomething?), you know, since people live forever with technology at \"dead=bad\" calendar \"Bad Friday,\" you know, \"dead=bad\" people live forever with technology at \"dead=bad\" calendar \"Bad Friday\" calendar rather than stealthysneakybloodyshredhumansGood Friday.

Changing calendar ACCELERATES TECHNOLOGY, you know, since \"dead=bad\" people live forever with tech at \"dead=bad\" calendar moral BAD FRIDAY calendar, rather than bloodyshredhumansGood Friday, one died, especially bad if Jesus was more than a man or woman or frog or turtle. Or \"Mourning Friday\" like at Germany.

FREEDOM. YOU DO AS YOU WISH, WHEN YOU WISH, FOR WHATEVER YOU WISH, AND YOU GET TO REMEMBER HOW SHITTY YOU CAN BE, BUT HOW. HOW. Crayon calendar-change? I believe the calendar-change, at \"Bad Friday\" IS MORE THAN MERELY DECORATIVE. I BELIEVE A CALCULATION OF 500 YEARS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR \"before and after mass calendar-change\" WILL REVEAL A UNIVERSAL PATTERN SUSTAINABLE. Meaning you saved yourselves against aging (and saving yourselves against aging, as, say \"frayed telomeres cellular, which no longer FRAY\" prevent wrinkles, aging, at cells which cease dividing, and cease multiplying, since frayed telomeres, yet now can be non-fraying, if managed properly since a cancer limiter at runaway cell growth, if non-fraying, and so, mending the telomeres can be harnessed (harnessed) (yay us! \"weeee!\" Who decides who lives and who dies? A calendar? A thing, non-biologic at a computer screen calendar? Who decides who lives and who dies? \"Ye are gods,\" your Jesus said, IN YOUR D.N.A. OF YOUR DESCENDANTS sooner or later, at many, many, many babies, your PARENTS already repeated and repeated, \"You will perform miracles greater than mine,\" at scale, at scale, of \"descend\" \"ants\" at scale sub-atomic to atomic to microscopic to human scale to galactic scale to multigalactic scale to nullspace blah blah blah seeming bland at blandness of seemingly nullspace \"descend\" \"ants\" \"You will perform miracles greater than mine\" is resonant from your PARENTS)). Yawn. \n\nPlanetary amnesty by calendar-change would indicate THE MURDERERS ARE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE, WHILE THE FALSE CHRISTIANS ARE AT THE BACK OF THE LINE. \"The first shall be last, and, the last shall be first,\" your Jesus said. HOW LONG IS THE WAITING LINE FOR LIVING FOREVER WITH TECH? One. Then whooooooooosh, the nanotechnology spreads everywhere.

Mary 11-to-14-yrs-aged-pregnant-w/Jesus, Joseph 90 years aged. See for yourself.\n\nIf anyone offers an alternative, I've found the permanently most effective words TO REPEAT AND REPEAT AND REPEAT AT THEM are, <sarcasm>\"Ohhhhhh, soooooooooooo much easier than announcing calendar-change, FOR SWINGING ALL PETITIONS (5,000 petitions, or FIVE MILLION PETITIONS), all swinging for 'good' SIMULTANEOUSLY rather than 'bad' at the shock of tolerating a 'good=death' calendar for so long (decades)\" </sarcasm> (the words work at just about any set of words offered to YOU, if someone offers words longer to YOU than merely \"Bad Friday\" or \"Mourning Friday\" like at Germany, or \"Yuck Friday\" (Crayon calendar-change), rather than bloodyshredhumansGood Friday, the varying names a proper polar opposite against the CATACLYSM which caused cannibals ATE (ATE) US.

She's on crutches so I pushed her around on the buggy with the two seat attachment for kids because there were no wheelchairs available. Anyway we proceeded to go to self checkout since we only had a few items. I went to the very last register near the door since I had such a large buggy. The cashier, Vanessa, was at the end cap straightening it out. She immediately left that area and decides to stand right behind me staring at us like we were criminals. Her reasoning for standing there is because \"these self checkouts always mess up.\" I didn't have one issue with the self checkout. She wanted to read the 4 coupons for eggland's best that I had so I gave it to her n scanned the rest of my items. She comes into my personal space, steps on my slipper because she's so close, and decides to scan my coupons herself. In the meantime, a guest next to us was asking her questions and wondering about a gift card deal. She's so busy in my area that she pretty much just tells the other guest oh well, you must've bought the wrong items. I'm pretty livid at this point. She infuriates me even more when she looks at my sister and tells her that she's going to have to ring up her own items n that I wouldn't be able to do it. My sister is in a boot and on crutches. Wth. She decides to look at her 4 coupons also. All while the guest next to us is still having issues. \n\nI understand watching out for coupon fraud and so on but for her to stare and be all up in my personal space, I do not agree with that. If target as a company is so scared of losing money from coupon fraud, don't bother putting in a self checkout then. Go ahead and have two cashiers with a line backed up to the clothes dept so that you can monitor every single transaction that goes thru. I'm sure this complaint is going to go nowhere because target on bayou is notorious for being unfriendly to couponers. You definitely need to train your cashiers a little better than this. I worked at this same location 10 years ago and it was never like this. You are starting to be worse than Walmart",

Your store refused to take the coupon you sent me in the mail that doesn't expire until December 2017.\nHonestly, this seems like a scam to me. You send us coupons on items that go on sale rarely and are expensive (in this case razor blades) to get us into the store, knowing that a) we will buy other things and b) most people buy those things when they actually have a need for them, so they're likely to take back the coupon and purchase the item at full price, especially if there are no manufacturer's coupons to use elsewhere. So you are sending this coupon you know you'll never have to accept.\nI told the cashier I would not purchase the razor blades and the dog food (rejected manufacturer's, will purchase at another store with said coupon), so your store lost about a $40 sale.\nUntil this policy is corrected I will only be purchasing generic products from your stores, and will purchase everything else at other stores that will allow the cashier to key in the coupon if it is valid and just isn't scanning. \nI wanted to send this in a private email, but could not find a way to do so on your website, which is why I'm listing my complaint here.",

I had the same exact product pulled up on my phone and ready to go (as I have done this a handful of times in the past and thought I knew the drill). The employee turned around to grab her iPad and starts looking it up, ok no big deal I thought, she'll find the same thing I did...WRONG! Target price was $49.99; Amazon was $30.39 (that's a significant savings!) the employee found it on her iPad Amazon for $44.99. I showed her my phone and she said oh well I have to go by what's on my iPad. I asked her when this started because I've done a price match within the past 3 months and no one has ever checked their iPad, she said oh it's been this way for years (horse poop!). I asked her how she searched for it and she said well I find it on target.com then hit the little Amazon button and this is what pops up. There was only ONE result the $44.99 one. I asked her to search by the name of the humidifier, she shrugged her shoulders at me and told me she didn't know how to do it. I asked to speak with a manager because I'm frustrated at this point and holding a sick, crying baby that has now thrown up on me. She leans over to the next register to ask the Team Lead, she babbled off something about not matching to Amazon Prime. I was logged into my Prime account so I guess that it was a special Prime only price. Ok fine, I didn't know the fine print to your price matching policy. I left the rest of the items in my cart out of sheer frustration and lack of professionalism that I received at the Guest Services counter by both the employee and the 'Team Lead'! I felt as thought I was standing at the Walmart customer service desk the way they were both talking down to me. \n\nI went out to my car and called the 800 number for Guest Services to let them know about my experience, that woman was just as unhelpful. She called the store talked to the Lead and came back and told me the same damn thing.\n\nI got home, logged or of my Prime account and searched for the product again...GUESS WHAT?! I found the same $30.39 price that wasn't connected to any type of Prime deal or special! I have a screenshot- but of course can't attach it to this post. \n\nI'll return to the store tomorrow and hopefully that same rude and unhelpful lady will be working again so I can win at your price matching game. This time I'll show her how to operate a search engine so she can in fact find the same pricing. \n\nSo disgusted with this experience, after I get my humidifier I most likely won't be returning to Target!",

I know it makes no difference to a large company like you, but your company has caused me more grief in the last 2 days than anyone should have to deal with at all, let alone from a company in which they've spent thousands and thousands of dollars. Upon concluding tonight's 4th or 5th phone call (I lost count) with your online CS department, my frustration will now have to wait another 24-48 hours because \"there's nothing else we can do\". You have been holding my online only, deliver to store only crib since the 9th. You have also been holding my $350 since then as well. No one informed me my crib was delivered to the store, so I called yesterday only to find out it's been in store since the 9th, but there was \"an error with the packing slip\". Due to this error, my online order was cancelled and I now have to go into the store to pay and pick it up. The only problem is you won't release my funds from a hold status so I can do that! Why should I have to pay \"with another form of payment\" when you're already holding my $350??? After about 10 phone calls between yesterday and today and 6 hours of going back and forth from person to person (none of which gave me the same information twice), department to department, I was left in tears with no resolution except to wait another 2 days to get my crib that has been sitting in the store since the 9th. I was assured it isn't business hours, but who knows at this point since no one at any of your call centers has their information straight, but if it business hours I'll then have to wait until Wednesday. Shame on you Target!",

THEY WERE NOT GENUINE \n\nsuper disappointing experience, i dont even use facebook and i felt this needed to be an outlet for those of you who live in chicago and have gone to the target on state st! do not go there. they are racially prejudice and will treat you as less of a human being if you are not white. i went into target today because i bought a allerease bed protector to my surprise my dad found one on amazon that was cheaper i spent upwards of 50 dollars on it , never open and i brought it to target still in the case still in the bag, told the \" customer service\" woman who looked like she was 2 minutes away from committing suicide and didn't even bother to look me in the eye nor say hello that i couldn't find my receipt but i bought it a few days prior and i never even opened it . she then proceeded to not say a word to me and just handed me a gift card with no receipt and no explanation ( i hate gift cards because i hate being limited to the store) i then waited and let the woman behind me go ahead because she had been waiting for ages. i asked her if i needed to have a gift card because i would prefer not to have one. she looked at me and said \" what that doesn't make any sense what are you trying to say\" and i said i do not want a gift card can i have a refund.. she once again did not look at me and got the \"manager\" Lauren who came out and proceeded to racially profile me even going so far as to call security and asking if i had stole something because god forbid someone of African american descent goes into target and wants a refund and not a giftcard i must have stole something. it took her 30 minutes to come back from the security office to then tell me she could give me my allerease back and i said fine i rather go to a different location than deal with the disrespect when target is supposed to be all about guest service ( bullshit) . she then proceeds to ring up the gift card and bed sheets to tell me that they didnt even put the amount i paid on the gift card and if i would like to pay the difference for the sheets i returned ........ and i asked her how does that make sense and she said i dont know and i should figure it out myself because i was holding up her line and as i walked away frustrated she even went as far to mumble some sort of \"black bitch\" under her breath. since im black i dont deserve customer service not to mention she gave a full cash refund to someone without a receipt before me. i will never shop at target a day in my life and im a receptionist at a law firm and thinking about taking out a civil suit against target .\nmoral of the story im super disgusted by the people this company employs with no morals and ethics.\nsorry about all the run ons really.really mad.",

We asked to speak with the manager, Gladys, who told us that the machines were closed because no cart attendant was working and that we were welcome to report this and, after being informed of the law and the requirement that a sign be posted, stated that there must have been a sign that was removed. She was rude and abrasive even when we asked if my husband and I could each return 25 bottles separately.

            "message": "I wanted to voice some frustration about a product I purchased at one of your stores a couple months ago. I bought these globe string lights in anticipation of moving into my new house that had a screened in porch. http://www.target.com/p/room-essentials-25ct-clear-globe-lights-purple-string/-/A-17186971?lnk=abtest_searchpdp_1\nIt took awhile to close on the house, move in and get settled so I just now got around to hanging them up. As I was stringing them, one of the tabs broke off the light connector and the whole thing came down, shattered glass everywhere, cutting my foot and narrowly missing my 3 year old, who was in the other room. I called customer service to get some resolution and the only suggestion he had was to contact the manufacturer. I'm not going to do that. How much time should I be spending trying to get a replacement for a part manufactured by Room Essentials, which is a Target brand? Last I checked, Target was a 73 billion dollar company and I spend hundreds of dollars there each month. I can't believe you can't offer to replace the product or at least refund the money I spent. The customer service rep said it was because the product was purchased more than 30 days ago and I would need to go to the store I bought it and speak with a manager about it. I moved several hours away from that store, so going there would be a major inconvenience. I'm just REALLY frustrated at the customer service of such a huge organization. It's not some mom and pop place that can't afford to do the right thing.",

I thought I had heard once upon a time that you had decided to do away with separating toys based on gender, and either you have but haven't gone nearly far enough, or the target stores in my area (my local Target store is in Westminster, CO at 104th and highway 36) just haven't had the makeover yet. My son is 5 and recently fell in love with these little Twozies collectibles when he saw a friend open them at her birthday party - but I had to buy him one in secret when he wasn't with me because he refuses to look twice in what seems obviously to him the Girl Toys Section. But yet here he is: a boy who loves that toy, so it must not be a girl toy! There are so many toys I know he would love or has told me he loves (many of the Lego Friends' collections) but would never see because the aisles are still so obviously biased based on gender. You are NAILING IT on the clothes, especially for girls (still waiting on the unicorn/rainbow/dragon/astronaut combo for my son haha), but this area still needs some serious work! We spend so much time at Target as a family, sometimes even just to kill some time we roam around and have fun, but I really hate bringing my kids to the toy area pretty much for this one reason. Thank you for all you do, the rest is Mom-Magic! <3",

After placing an order online for several items to be picked up IN STORE and the remaining to be shipped to my home, I find out that an item was canceled and was unable to be picked up in store. Which typically wouldn’t be a problem because I wasn’t charged for the item; however I ordered four towels and now only had three. Anyone can see how this could be an issue.  The store clerk told me there was nothing they could do and I have to REORDER the item online.  So I called Target online Customer Service at 1-800-591-3869, and spent over THIRTY minutes talking to a representative who refused multiple times for me to speak to a manager/supervisor.  This was after she recommended for me to drive to the next nearest Target to purchase the item in person. Great, she wanted me to drive three hours roundtrip to the next nearest target for a freaken towel to complete the set.  Then she told me to just to go online and reorder the item.  So let me explain WHY this is an issue: I took advantage of a sale on home goods on 15 sept on a set of towels, each costing $13.99 with the 30% discount.  Now because of an error on Target’s part, because I had the option to purchase all four and have it shipped to my home but was given the option to pick them up all in store; I’m being told to reorder ONE towel at $19.99 + $4.00 shipping for a total after taxes at $25.19.  DO YOU NOW SEE MY FRUSTRATION?\nAll I asked if for the item to be shipped with the remaining items. Was told they could not change the order. I finally get to speak to a manager, he informs me that he will waive my shipping charge but cannot allow me to purchase the item at the sale price. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? \nNearly 35 minutes FOR NOTHING! I've ordered nearly $3000 on patio set, bedding, and towels from target in the last two weeks. THIS experience has defiantly made me want to return it all right back!",

Carts blocking aisles all through the baby, toy, and electronics areas and most of the time grocery (thankfully not today). The employee and the manager \"LOD\" I spoke to about it were put off and not at all concerned about the customer experience when I pointed it out to them. \n\nThis is so frustrating when I spend $100+ every week. I can spend it at Amazon and save the hassle of dragging two small children through the store. I am beginning to believe that's a much better option.",

Kline  (TMFDankline) dated Sep 15, 2016 at 11:30AM: \"Part of Target's Q2 problem came from the customer boycott over its decision to allow people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with rather than their birth gender. The company has partially addressed that by committing to add single-person bathrooms to all its stores, but it's possible that a small percentage of its audience may not come back due to its stance.\" So, as I've declared all along, boycotts work.",

We have used these diapers on my 20 month old since she was about 3-4 months old and now I will no longer be purchasing them unless they go back to the old design. They are cheaply made, the wetness indicator does not work properly, the diaper itself gets raggedy in the crotch after some wear, and the gel beads are coming out of the diaper every time. I do not feel like this is safe for my daughter as what does the build up of that going into her lady parts do?? This used to happen on the old diapers overnight, if she drank a lot before bed but this is happening every single diaper. We are going to stop use immediately and go pick up a box of pampers on our way home. I'm truly saddened as we used to love your diapers and would drive 30 minutes out of our way to purchase them. Please give me some insight as to why you changed your diapers for the worse and the safety of these gel beads coming out please.",

Let me explain....\n\nI walked into your store looking for one specific non-clothing item (sorry Kaitlyn but they do not have the amazing 1-20 spaceship counting puzzle in the dollar bin area). Magically- your store had the ability to pull me in past the dollar bins. I immediately felt the need to check out several departments to also find a good deal. \n\nAnd bingo-bango.... there it was- the most glorious outfit I had ever laid my eyes on. In that moment- I was so excited that I sent a picture to my boyfriend saying \"best $6 ever!\" and then found myself walking to the register with my shoulders back and head held high. I felt victorious with this shopping trip. Proof is in the pictures below. \n\nA day has gone past .... and Target- I would like to congratulate you on swindling me again! I walked in with all intentions to find that puzzle and walked out with something I never thought existed. \n\nSincerely, \nProud Owner of The Marshmallow Man outfit",

I swiped my MasterCard and it said it was declined because of insufficient funds (which was untrue because I know funds were there) cashier told me to swipe it again, so I did.. Same thing happened. At this point my 3 kids were pretty much crying so I paid it in cash.. To then see my card was charged 2x for $15.54- I then proceeded to guest services where I was treated not very nicely which unfortunately is NOT the first time. The gentleman then told me... It will dissapear off my card... Really???? I asked what about the funds that were deducted?  I'm sorry to say but this was handled very unprofessionally, and as always a very unpleasant experience. And I'm now out $31.08.",

Tuesday, September 13, I visited the Flowood, MS store around noon. I purchased 2 bowls of the Hormel mashed potatoes. My 4 year old loves these. I pulled them out of the fridge to cook them and the expiration date on 1 of them was September 11. They expired 2 days before I bought them. Fortunately, the other bowl expired October 7. I have looked for the receipt, but I cannot find it. I guess it was thrown away. Will I be able to exchange them? Thanks!",

            "message": "Looking to share a recent experience with you.  I've been a RedCard customer since February of 2015 and a customer of Target for far longer than that.  On September 3rd, I planned to switch bank accounts so on September 2nd I placed a payment to prevent any issues during the change.  On September 3rd I added my new account and edited my auto pay to use this new bank account.  On September 12th my Autopay triggered.  When I went into Target today, my card didn't work.  I tried logging into my account to find that I had been charged $25 two separate times for missed payments and that my online account was locked.\n\nI immediately dialed to pay my balance in full.  I was informed that I would not be reimbursed for either returned payment, despite the fact that the 2nd payment was proactive on my end to avoid such a situation.  I was also informed that my account was permanently closed and that I could no longer use the RedCard.  As a customer of years with thousands of dollars of annual spend with no previous incidents, that is absolutely absurd.  In 2 weeks my account was locked and deleted and sent to debt collectors due to a mistake and a very typical life change.  I was not contacted by phone or email and didn't receive a letter until the night I dialed. Target, you've lost a customer for life unless you remedy the situation.  I'll get what I need from the grocery store and Amazon until then.",

I find that in the store the television is not on sale, but I am told by an employee that the store could price match if I take it to customer service. I think great, I really want this television! I go to customer service and show the employee the website she then looks it up on the iPad. Well here is where it get fun, the employee informs me that this tv is NOT on sale, the television that is on sale is the REGULAR Visio 32. I would like to know how you can use pictures of a television that is NOT what you have listed? Is that false advertising. Also, I find a floor model futon that I am in love with! I ask after looking all over the store so I go on line to find the price which is $129.99. I ask an employee if you have it I am told its in the back because there were none in the spot where they should be on the shelf and once again the price is different than the price on the website the price on the shelf is $179.99 the price on the website is $129.99. I'm told it is a discontinued item, why is it that you have it advised in the store and have a label and shelf space for it if you do not even have it in the company? I then ask if I can buy the floor model. The employee asked the manager, I am then told \"we cannot sell it because the floor model is not for sale AND it is not made to the same standard as the one a customer would buy.\" I wanted some answers so, I call your customer service number and am given the run around and am told oh well about the fact that you advised the wrong television on your website than that the description is. I am told by the person on the phone that your mobile  customer service is full and I can wait on told which I do for 45 minutes. Then I am told to still wait, when I ask for a phone number so I can call back I am given a NON toll free number and when I question this I am told that if I do not wanna pay I should wait on hold. To say I am very disappointed in the service and my experience with your company is an understatement.",

I'm not sure what you're changing internally, but the past year or so has seen your customer service disintegrate to Wal-Mart levels. My experience over the last two days has only confirmed the decline.\nI was shopping in-store yesterday when I noticed a particular stand mixer in the clearance section and was stunned with delight at the price, but confused as to why is was that price. I found an associate (Employee#1) to help confirm the price so I could pay for my treasure immediately. She confirmed the price, but didn't have another in stock. The supervisor (Emp#2) stopped by the \"educate me\" on how clearance works and suggested I go to a different Target to see if they still had one. I was disappointed that she thought the way she spoke to me was anything close to polite, or helpful. I asked her how she was going to resolve this situation and offered to take the same unit in a different color at the promised price and was again \"educated\" that Target \"doesn't do that sort of thing\". \nEmployee#1 offered to call other stores for me to find the product and possibly transfer it to our store. I happily agreed. She called another store and waited.... for 40 minutes. Knowing that a customer is waiting, and another Target employee is waiting, it still took the second store 40 minutes to locate and secure the item for transport. \nAt this point I had been in the store with this issue for over an hour and (Emp#1) was beside herself apologizing for the wait and for the inconvenience. She treated me like a person, not a transaction, and for that I'm grateful.\nToday I was pleasantly surprised to hear that my product arrived, but it wasn't the right product, and I was informed that there was a miscommunication about the pricing and I wouldn't be receiving the product I wanted in any color at the promised price. The options given to me were to take the wrong product at a \"clearance\" price both Amazon and Costco beat on a daily basis, or pay full price for the product I wanted but included a $35 gift card.\nIn the end, you won. I had them price match Amazon, they gave a 15% discount to apologize for my inconvenience, and the $35 gift card. I feel cheated, disappointed, disheartened. This is the quality of customer service Target gives now? I'll be giving away the gift card and shopping at Amazon for their vastly superior customer service, and Wal-Mart for their better prices.\n\nEvery time I use that mixer I'll remember that Target breaks promises.",

I BELIEVE A CALCULATION OF 500 YEARS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR \"before and after mass calendar-change\" WILL REVEAL A UNIVERSAL PATTERN SUSTAINABLE. Meaning you saved yourselves against aging (and saving yourselves against aging, as, say \"frayed telomeres cellular, which no longer FRAY\" prevent wrinkles, aging, at cells which cease dividing, and cease multiplying, since frayed telomeres, yet now can be non-fraying, if managed properly since a cancer limiter at runaway cell growth, if non-fraying, and so, mending the telomeres can be harnessed (harnessed) (yay us! \"weeee!\" Who decides who lives and who dies?

I shopped for about 2 hours and then went to self checkout to ring myself out. I did 5 separate transactions so I could use my cartwheel bc you can use it up to 6 times a day. And I used category  coupon for beverage. I was ring myself out minding my own business with my one year old with me. When a worker named Jennifer came over and tried to cancel my transaction. None of my coupons. Beeped. I didn't need anyone's help. I became upset and told her to get away. She said she was getting manger. She continued to say things and make me more angry. While I had my daughter in my arms. The manger came over I told him what happened he fixed my last transaction bc the computer froze or something happened and he fixed. I left. Well in all the commotion I left two packs of water I bought. I called and told them. And they said bring my Receipt back and I could get the water. Yesterday I return to the store where I was approached by loss prevention and he wanted to talk to me. He asked me what happened I told him. He said that's the story I'm getting. I said so whats the problem. He said that they fear for there safety and they have to ban me from store. I'm like are you serious.  Year to date I have spent just with my red card 3500 hundred dollars. That doesn't count all my gc I have used. I think it's a little extreme to say they fear for there safety. I shop there all the time and have never had a problem ever. I find it very offensive that your employees have problems  with couponers. I'm a mom of three kids. I have to save every penny I can. I do my best save so my kids can have everything. Banning from store that I only live 10 mins from and spend a lot of time in money is extreme.",

So I took the set of cookware up to the Customer Service Desk and asked about the price, the employee stated that she could not override a Clearance price.  I showed her on my phone the set of cookware that I wanted to purchase and the price it was showing was 59.99 and says sale ends on Sunday, she again stated that it was Target's policy not to override a clearance item with an item found on Target.com.  I explained to her that the Target.com site states the item is available only in stores.  I asked to speak to a manager, and the manager told me that Target.com can list any price they chose and the store does not have to honor that price.  My question to him then was: why does Target.com show an item that can only be purchased at the store with one price but the store does not have to honor that price. His answer was because a different store can sell it at a different clearance price.  But the ad specifically says \"Sale ends Sunday\" that does not mean it is clearance.  I asked him for an 800# for their Customer Service so I could register a complaint and he gave me a number for Target.com, and they could not help me, in fact they somehow disconnected the call.  I am not sure I will ever step foot in a Target store again, especially the ones in Winchester Virginia.",

I asked several times how she come up with .50 off instead of adjusting to .74 off . i showed her the target coupon policy from my smartphone  which reads that :Target accepts one (1) manufacturer coupon and one (1) Target store coupon for the same item (unless prohibited by either coupon). Coupon amount may be reduced if it exceeds the value of the item after other discounts or coupons are applied (no cash back).

I ordered a Melissa and Doug Victorian dollhouse and a bundle of six (individually packaged) dollhouse rooms (kitchen, bathroom, dining room, living room, etc.) for my daughter's only birthday present. It was a big-ticket toy item costing over $220; a very expensive present in our home. I ordered it early so I'd have time to assemble the dollhouse and set up the rooms. One of the individually packed rooms was labled dining room but it had living room furniture in it! What?!? As a result, I had two living rooms and no dining room. I called customer service and told them about the problem and the error the Target quality-control department had made, thinking this would be an easy problem to fix. The Target rep told me to take the bundle of six rooms back to Target and they would ship me out a new one. I explained how that was a problem because the correct bundle likely wouldn't arrive until after her birthday and I wasn't willing to give up all six rooms and give her an empty dollhouse. I tried idea after idea to find a solution (have them expedite the shipping, or send me a new bundle now and I return the bad one, or send me an individual dining room instead of the bundle, etc.). Nothing worked and the Target rep refused to help me find a solution to their quality problem. I was so extremely frustrated with the Target rep and her robotic answers and her unwillingness to help. So, from what the Target rep told me, it appears my only choice is to give my daughter the five rooms for her birthday and then pack them back up the next day and ship all six rooms back to Target so they can (hopefully) send me another bundle with a correctly-packaged dining room. What a terrible answer Target! I am so terribly dissappointed in Target's error and their refusal to fix it. This is a toy for a little girl; her only birthday present shouldn't have to be taken away because Target's quality-control department failed and Target's customer-service rep was incompetent to help a long-time customer. So very wrong Target; you will lose customers this way!",

It doesn't take much to put a smile on my face. Thank God young, respectable people with work ethic do still exist.

            "message": "I want to say I am so disappointed with Target and the so called warranty plans you sell. So this morning I woke to my son's PS4 not working and our wireless router not working. I purchased warranty plans for both. I called to start a claim on the PS4 and ended up with a rude representative. He continued to argue with me that my warranty was not for a PS4 but an Xbox. I told him I have the original reciept and the only items on it was the PS4 and the extended warranty. He placed me on hold before I had even finished speaking with him. He came back on the line, asked me to verify the model number, asked for my address that I had to repeat to him a few times then stated he would email me some label to which them I would need to pack up the PS4 and then I should get it back in a few weeks. I still had a claim to put in for the router and he hung up. So I tried to place a claim for my router online since I really didn't want to speak with someone again for fear I would only be upset more to only then get a message that says I need to call the manufacture of my router since it should still be under the original warranty which I knew was not correct since it's been over 12 months. I decided to call Netgear anyway to only confirm that my warranty with then did expire. So now I had to call and speak with someone in the Target Asurion warranty department again. Really sweet girl so I am grateful for that however she stated the system was saying Netgears warranty was 36months in one part of the system and that it had expired in another. She tried to correct it and then it flagged my claim stating it now needed review before it could even be started and that it could take 3 days for someone to call me to review it. So I my son does not have his $400.00 PS4 and we do not have our $170.00 wireless router even though I have purchased the extended 2 year warranty for both. This experience was an eye opener for me. Best Buy will be getting my business on large purchases from now on. I use to ALWAYS by my electronics from Best Buy because their warranty plan is AWESOME and so customer friendly. Anytime one of my warranty items had issues at Best Buy I could take the product and my receipt to customer service where they would check out my product to confirm it was not working and simply provide us with new merchandise and allowed for us to purchase a new warranty for our replaced items. Then out the door and back to enjoying our items. I am sick and have been on the phones since 9:00am and it is now 1:30. I have non working products, no shipping label for one and have to wait 3 days to get a call about another. Poor customer service Target. You really need to rethink how you do your warranty replacement process. You have lost me as customer. I will be sharing this complaint with the BBB as well since something isn't right with all of the wrong information the warranty departments has and the hassle you have to go through for something we paid for as a peace of mind. This has been nothing more than a NIGHTMARE. I now have to go out purchase a wireless router so my husband can work since it will be who know when before my claim is taken care of.",

She goes to the counter at target to do the return unfortunately she didn't have receipt since she wasn't giving a gift receipt. So she proceeds to the counter where the girl at the counter says to her I will need and ID so my sister gives her her Mexican ID since that's all she has since she comes and visits with family thru the year. So the girl tell her she can not return the item since she needs an ID from the USA. so my sister explains I don't have one since I only visit so the girls has the audacity to tell my sister to \"TO GO BACK AND RETURN THE ITEM TO HER COUNTRY\". The worse part was there was manger and did not help her out with what she needed. So when she called me to tell me what had happen I just cant believe that something would happen due to there are a lot of Hispanic in the state of Texas.

I shop at Target weekly sometimes even multiple trips a week.  \nThe young man that I had checking me out seemed fine and nice as usual until we got to the coupons.  He was fine through everything until the last two that wouldn't go through.  I asked if we could have the manager come over as the coupon stated the brand of razors and the only other stipulation was that it couldn't be the smaller package with just two in it.  I did purchase the brand and I did purchase the package with three in it so it was exactly as it states on the coupon.  A woman came back and said that they could not take the coupon which was fine. I then said that's fine but please remove the 4 packages of razors off my order  since they would not use the coupons.  The man was rushing and taking stuff off and then I couldn't really see what he did.  I paid and then while walking out I looked at the Receipt.  I noticed that he did not take off one of the packages of razors.  I went up to the same lady who said they wouldn't take the coupons and asked her what I needed to do and she said for me to go to customer service.  I then went up there, explained now to a new person what had happened and then he proceeded to void my entire purchase and take off the entire order.  Talk about a mess.  He call the same girl over and she tried fixing it and couldn't  Anyways after 30 minutes waiting for this issue to be fixed. I was told that it was and that I now had to be charged again for the entire purchase due to the void.  \nWhen all was said and done, I am not sure I will ever go back.  It wasn't the point of the money for the refund, It was the point of poor customer service, and having to explain myself to many people. At the very end of the mangers came back as when all this was happening she was radioed and said on the radio that she was going on break for someone else to help.  Very poor customer service and follow up on the entire issue.  I had mentioned at the end that the new Keuriq that I purchased last night had a sign right in front of it and on the isle that many more were located on that also said that you will receive a $10.00 gift card.  She said well it doesn't show that and did not even bother to go and have someone look.  Honestly I felt like saying just take my whole cart and return it all and give me my money back!  The sign clearly stated this in the store and they did not even investigate or honer the sign even if it was still up from a previous sale or some other special! $236.00 plus dollars later I walked out of the store with no gift card for the coffee maker, a huge mess from not taking off the razors, and I am still checking and making sure that this mess of a order did not get charged to my card twice.... I am not happy!",

Probably embarrassing to admit that, but there you go.\n\nAnyway, I use coupons regularly. On my weekly trip to Target yesterday, I purchased some clearance school supplies and tried to use coupons for my purchase.  The coupons were for the correct item, they had not expired, and they were not for more than the reduced price.\n\nThe cashier tried to scan them and they were all refused.  When I asked her why, I was told that they had a new system, and that if they didn't scan, they could not be accept.\n\nI confirmed with her and with the front end manager that the coupons were, in fact, for the items purchased and they were, in fact, valid coupons, and yet they were still refused.\n\nI was told that they got new coupon systems in place because of coupons not being compensated for by the manufacturers.  Other than the system not accepting them, when I asked why they were not accepted, I was only told, \"I don't know.\"  I was also told, \"I don't know,\" by the store manager.  He was very abrupt and didn't seem to care either way.  \n\nNo other explanation was given, and the answer given to me was not even given with any sort of apology.  Very matter of fact.\n\nI purchased the items, anyway, as I still wanted them.  I asked if coupons on clearance items would be refused in the future and was again told, \"I don't know.\"  If they do not know, I think it is their duty to find out.\n\nI called the 1-800 number and was told the same thing: \"I don't know.\"  The woman I spoke to was polite and understanding.  I still don't understand how no one knows.\n\nCan you please let me know why it states on the website that coupons are accepted on reduced item, but they were not accepted in-store.  And if the items purchased are correct and the coupon is not expired (and is a coupon from the Sunday paper - not even a printed coupon), will the new system continue to reject coupons at its whim?\n\nI'm not going to threaten not to shop Target, anymore, because I am addicted, but please try to explain this system to me because it makes no sense and it made me quite sad.",

Why does this happen? Since they (there was another young lady @ the SP🎯) did NOT honor it I returned the product because of the lack of helpfulness- they rather show me that when she scanned the Kleenex on her phone that there was NO cartwheel on what I was buying!

On September 13th, I realized Target had lowered the price on their mixers and found the same mixer I ordered on Amazon.com for almost $100 less!! Shopped at a Target store yesterday and asked a lady working in the Return area if I could return it or if they'd match Amazon's price. She stated I could return it but they would not price-match Amazon because it's a Prime price and you have to be a member to receive that price. Obviously, she has never used Amazon before because the price is the same regardless if you are a member or not. I'd just receive free 2-day shipping because I am a member. My packages from Target were delivered while I was away from home yesterday. I opened them this morning to discover that the platter was broken in transit. I will be returning the mixer and platter and hope to not encounter a problem with either. Overall, I am extremely disappointed with my transaction and don't plan to shop online with Target again!",

They received the glider by UPS and the glider was broken. Our daughter called Target and they said they would send her a replacement. The Customer Service Representative asked her to take the broken Glider to UPS. The Glider weighs 52 pounds; she told him she was unable to take it to UPS so Target said they would arrange a UPS pick up. I called Target as well and expressed my disappointment that the glidet was broken. The Representative apologized for the broken item and said he would send a $50 Gift Certificate for our trouble. The replacement Glider arrived and it too was broken. I called Target. When the Representative answered the phone, it sounded like someone was having a house party. I thought I had dialed the wrong number so I asked her if this was Target. Yes, It was Target. I asked to speak to a Supervisor. She transferred the call to a Supervisor. I explained the situation and the Supervisor said something to the effect of \"what do you want me to do? I asked her to document that the 2nd Glider was broken and I would call back because at that point I was extremely frustrated with their whole Customer Service experience. I called Target back and spoke to a different Representative. This Representative seemed very concerned and helpful. She told me that she would have to arrange a UPS pick up of the 2nd Glider. She said they would not be able to send out another replacement Glider. I would have to place a new order and pay for another one. She said Target would start a refund for the first order and it would take 7-10 days to refund my credit card for the original order. She also said she would start the process for UPS to pick up the 2nd Glider. The Customer Servive Representative said she would call me back the next day and I could place a new order for the Glider if my daughter still wanted it. She also said she would give me a $50 discount on the new order due to the  problems we had experienced. I felt relieved and pleased at the end of the conversation. (It was too good to be true.) I waited for her call the next day but didn't hear from her. I called Target's Registry and explained what had transpired with the 2 Gliders to a different Representative. He put me on hold for about 5 minutes. A Supervisor came on the line and told me that he would have to arrange a UPS pick up for the 2nd broken Glider. Once Target received the Glider they would process a refund to my credit card; it would take 7-10 days. He said the process had not been initiated by the Target Representative that I had spoken to the night before; nothing had been done. After he told me how he was going to handle the process of the return I asked him about purchasing a new glider for my daughter and told him the previous Representative was going to give me $50 off the price of the glider. He put me on hold and when he came back on the phone he said he could not honor that because the previous Representative did not document what she had told me. I was livid, truly upset that Target was not going to honor what I had been told. I made another call to Target.com to file a complaint and was told the same thing...because the Representative didn't document the conversation, they would not change their decision, or honor what I had been told.

Target's policy has now resulted in at least two separate sexual violations on women in Texas stores. The latest was just last week, when a man used his cell phone to video a woman in a changing room in a Dallas Target store.\n\nIn response, Attorney General Ken Paxton again reached out to Target, saying, \"After this latest incident, I hope Target finally recognizes the importance of protecting its customers, especially in environments where they can be at their most vulnerable. I am offering them the resources of my office to help assist them in improving their safety procedures.\"\n\nAttorney General Paxton is taking a courageous stand against Target's unsafe and dangerous policy of allowing men into women’s bathrooms and dressing rooms. And...he's not afraid to step on some corporate toes to make sure companies don't put women and children at risk from sexual predators.",

Though you claim your policy is the only way to be non-discriminatory, you discriminate against female shoppers by requiring they share bathrooms and changing rooms with men.  Since the announcement of your policy, Sean Smith, who identifies as a woman, was arrested for taking pictures of a woman changing clothes in a Target dressing room, and two other men were caught filming young girls in Target dressing rooms.  Non-discriminatory policies like that which you have adopted pave the way for voyeurism and assault, such as when child molester Christopher Hambrook sexually assaulted women in shelters by claiming to be transgender.  I cannot in good conscience patronize your stores until you reverse this policy, though I certainly miss doing business with you.",

I input all of the information and when I hit the \"ready to checkout\" button, I got a message saying that the item could not be shipped to my address. I live in an apartment in Los Angeles, 4 blocks from a Target store that does not have the item in stock. They can't deliver to me? So I hit the contact button and select to \"chat\" with someone. It told me I had a 5 minute wait time. So I waited. At the end of 5 minutes, it said that there was no one to help me and it said to call the 800 number. So I called the 800 number. I finally got a real person, that was nice. He said he could help me and he tried inputting the info to have it sent to me and told me that he got a message saying the product couldn't ship to my address. All this time for him to tell me, what I told him to begin with. He had no idea what was going on. I asked politely if I could speak to a manager and he said \"of course\". Then he hung up on me. This is why Amazon is kicking butt. I don't know why I ever try to buy anything from anyone but Amazon. My experience with Target was  1) You can't send me a product, 2) You can't tell me why,  3) your \"chat\" option made me wait 5 minutes before telling me that I needed to call the 800#, 4) I call the 800# and the employee obviously didn't know what to do and was no help, and finally  5) the target customer service person hung up on me. I would be somewhat impressed if someone actually got back to me about this, was knowledgeable, and actually tried to help me out.",

Because who keeps their used gift card that long.\nYour rep told me it was MY fault and I shouldn't have thrown the gift card. Claiming they couldn't find the gift card number. After TWENTY minutes they magically found it. \nWell they sent me a $10 gift card through email to replace the $10 I spent.\nWell now, they just charged me $15 for the $25 promotional gift card I NEVER GOT. Only the $10 one for what I paid with. \nYour supervisor for target.com argued with me adamantly and gave me attitude like no other, that yes I got that email for the $25 gift card. His name was John. He kept sighing and acting like there was no way I was clueless and I was some sort of idiot.\nThankfully a supervisor from your gift card department told me no, I wasn't insane and no I didn't get the gift card via email like he claimed.\nI'm out of money you should of never taken and out the Car seat that I needed. Because apparently your online store has MULTIPLE discontinued car seats still available for purchase.\nCurrently your gift card supervisor is working to give me the money I should of never paid back. Thankfully she was amazing after dealing with the idiots I had before her.\nIt's really unfortunate I spent a total of an hour and a half on the phones, with no one caring about me as a customer. Now while at least someone is finally working to resolve it... it makes it really hard to trust you to order again.\nNow while this all seems like petty money to you, it's still not money you should of messed with.\nTHANK GOODNESS I have a bank app and caught it. I cant even imagine with your carseat promo how many others this probably happened to when their orders were cancelled.",

The town is really cruisey and I’m able to slip right into the pace of things. I’ve always felt comfortable here and I’m looking forward to a good event.”\nDespite seeming to run away with the ASP World Title after blitzing the first half of the 2009 season, Parkinson has stumbled in the last two events, collecting back-to-back equal 17ths in California and France. Even with the slip in performance, the Australian still remains in the ASP World Tour ratings’ lead and will look to rebound at the famed lefthander.\n“Everyone has a couple events where they don’t get the results they’re looking for,” Parkinson said. “I’m not thinking about the last two events. I’m only focused on the one in front of me. I love Mundaka when it’s on and I’m looking at putting in another good performance here this season.”\nC.J. Hobgood (USA), 30, defending Billabong Pro Mundaka winner and current ASP World No. 3, defeated Parkinson in a gun-slinging Final last year and is excited about the possibility of getting the break good this season.\n“The sand looks really good and I heard there may be a swell coming next week which would be really exciting,” Hobgood said. “For me, I am just looking forward to having a normal event. I had a little bit shocker in France – I had my boards stolen, came back in a pretty exciting heat and then lost sooner than I would have hoped. I’m having an okay year, but I really want to win an event. I want a breakout event. Hopefully the magic is still here for me in Mundaka.”\nIn addition to proving pivotal in the hunt for the 2009 ASP World Title, the Billabong Pro Mundaka is also an important event for those looking to requalify for next year’s ASP Dream Tour.\nTiago Pires (PRT), 29, current ASP World No. 23, is coming off of his best result of the year, a 3rd in France, where he halted a rampaging nine-time ASP World Champion Kelly Slater (USA), 37, in the Quarterfinals. Brimming with confidence and at ease in Europe, Pires will be a major threat at the upcoming Billabong Pro Mundaka.\n“I was having a pretty hard year until the last event,” Pires said. “I think I moved up like 10 spots on the ratings and now I feel confident heading into the rest of the year. Everywhere in Europe feels like home and I love the wave at Mundaka. I am looking to continue my momentum through the next two events.”\nThe Billabong Pro Mundaka will host the world’s best surfers from October 5 through 17, 2009.  The event will be webcast LIVE via billabongpro.com/mundaka09. For more information, log onto aspworldtour.com",

Out of an order of 48 items six had broken lids, 8 had torn outer packaging and that is not all. The box  with the 48 jars with not one bit of packaging material. That's right, 48 jars were simply boxed up and shipped out. There was not one word of FRAGILE  or GLASS or any indication that the contents were breakable on the outside of the box. Here is the really weird thing: Of the six jars with broken lids there were only FOUR pieces of broken plastic were in the box! Maybe I am wrong but if there are six broken jars and four pieces that match up with the jars it seems to me that the box was shipped with six already broken jars.  I have placed the same order previously and the items were boxed in individual boxes of four each then boxed in a larger container with packaging material between the boxes and GLASS stamped all over the box. Someone was either asleep or on some kind of mind altering substance when they boxed and shipped this order. I tried and tried to contact Walmart by phone but each time I was either hung up on after entering the numbers they asked for or the auto-machine kept asking for the \"order number\" then telling me there was no such order!  There is no place on the Walmart pages to send pictures, they make things VERY difficult to do anything except BUY!",

Because I used it they said they could only return to my card. But did not explain that it could take 5 to 7 business days. Due to an emergency I had to wait on this refund to get essentials for my family.  Now had I been told it could take that long I would have asked for a gift card instead, so I could buy what I needed at the time. I looked all over your website, store policy, all over the Internet looking for a range as to when I would expect my refund. No where, I mean no where does it state how long it could take. So I decided to call your customer relations, which is a joke of a title. I spoke to Charles and he sounded so inexperienced that I was amazed that he was on the phone. Yes, I'm frustrated. Yes, I'm tired from my ER visit. And this rep was clearly trying to get me off the phone with no information. I received no help at all as to what to do. And when I asked for a supervisor he refused till the 4th time I asked. He kept trying to say it was a Savings Catcher issue. When I tried to explain it was actual funds of my own he still tried to tell me the same thing. Then told me to call a different number but gave me no explanation as to why I should call or even what they do. He just kept saying he didn't know and to try someone else or that I just have to wait. He kept telling me I had to call Bluebird. Bluebird can't do anything because they have no information on the refund. Then he says I had to call the number he gave me. When I asked if he could transfer me, that's when he proceeded to tell me their closed for the day! Then I finally got Will, a supervisor for customer relations, he did tell me that I had to call card processing services. The same people that Charles said to call but they are closed. Even though Will didn't have much more to say, he did have the experience and maintained his cool as a customer service rep should do. Either way I'm stuck because you guys don't know how to train your employees properly. No one can explain how long it will take or why. No one told me not to plan on having my money back. Any other company and I get my refund with in a day or 2. But not Walmart. This has been the worst experience I have had with you guys. I'm done with walmart. I will be taking my business to a store that actually explains what's going on and not try to give me the run around. Somewhere that values my money as a paying customer. Hopefully you guys don't have an emergency and end up in the same situation.",

They couldn't fulfill the order ( after I contacted THEM a day later), so I cancelled the order and they were to refund my money. Flash forward a week and my money was still not refunded, so I AGAIN contacted them only to be told that the order was NEVER actually canceled. Great. I would be getting my refund in 5 business days. Here we are, another week later, another call to Walmart and they want me to wait another 5 business days. SERIOUSLY!!!!!. If it was 20$ I'd say forget it. It's 165$ that they are basically refusing to give me back for an item I've never even laid eyes on! I had a similar issue with Toys r Us and they had my money back in my account in 2 days and- gave me the same item with 50$ off as a courtesy. I now have to wait 3-5 business days AGAIN for my money.

They don't  have ANYMORE TIMES to be disrespectful to my mother. Period. That store has the worst customer service ever, I don't live there anymore but my experience there in July wasn't great either. However, I am (at this moment I'm typing) listening to my mother explain how she was treated badly by an employee who clearly doesn't understand that I WILL FLY TO NEW YORK and personally show her how to speak to adults, elders and the public in general. PERIOD! I worked for your company years ago, and I never ever treated a customer in the manner in which my mother is explaining to me. That store needs to be SHUT DOWN and the WHOLE store needs customer relation training. Treating people with kindness is never an option it's mandatory, if you're being mistreated as an employee then you call your manager.",

After waiting 3 more days I call again and again I am told the same thing, it isn't there.  I talk to a manager who gives me the number to Walmart.com orders and I talk to a man who tells me the TV is actually on back order.  I was never told that or sent any correspondence of that nature.  I waited for 20 days for a product that was never coming and my card was charged.  How can that be?

I took it home, spent 4 hrs putting it together, and once completed thought not only was is such a good buy but also beautiful in my living room. Well yesterday when i arrived home from work the entire desk was on the floor including my computer!!!! No kids, no pets, and no one in the home at the time the desk had fallen. It appears the wood the desk it built with is of poor quality. I literally lost $90 in a product I didn't get any use out of!",

I call it bait and switch.  I tried to order a simple\" pioneer women tea box for $28 the WM web site said it was in stock at that store, went down ,, not there.  So that night I purchased it on line so I could pick up at a different store the next day,, strike 2 not in stock, if it's at one warehouse it will take two days if it's at another warehouse it will take two weeks. I talked to a supervisor, this is what I gathered, instock at a store doesn't mean it's at the store but it's supposed to be, maybe. Online availability is  really not there cause it might be at two different locations depending what it is.. so DON'T believe what you read cause even the stores don't know cause the system only update at midnight, but that's not true either cause this morning my tea box should be at three stores in Alamance county but I know it's not.. confused yet. Billion dollar company and you can't find products.. sad",

            "message": "I have never been more disgusted with a lack of customer service than I am right now with this store. (Walmart of White Lake, MI) Let's start by saying I lived next to this store for years and have exclusively shopped here for years. A lot of staff know me by name. I've never had as much trouble as I have over the last 4 days. Saturday (9/17/16) My husband and I purchased an Xbox One Console (No mention of one coming out in a couple days.. thanks, we would of waited) We spent a big chunk of money purchasing it, accessories and games. We were told that xbox 360 games would work on it so we bought our boys a Ninja Turtles game. It's 4 player and we could all play it on family game nights. We get home.... it doesn't work... I go back up Sunday night, explain what happened and the girl in electronics apologized. We weren't going to by another one there but game stop had just closed and I made a promise to the kids. We grabbed a Ninja Turtle game (different one) for the Xbox One and exchanged it. We even purchased the protection plan. The game says 2-4 player co-op (I haven't owned an xbox in years, I have no clue what the lingo means) I asked the girl and she said that all four of us could play it but co-op meant online. I specifically asked if all four of us could play under one Xbox live account and with one console. She assured me repeatedly it would.  We paid, got a ton of groceries ( another $200 spent there) and left. We got home and GUESS WHAT. It doesn't work! Imagine how disappointed my kids were. I tried to take the game back today (9/21/16) but Shawn the \"Manager on Duty\" was a complete unprofessional jerk. Monotone and refused to even listen to me. Kept interrupting me and then said no call Walmart and walked away. Seriously? That's your customer service? Some one spends over $700 at  your store in 4 days and  you wont honor your mistake over a $50 game? I tried calling the 800 number but big surprise... I got hung up on twice before even getting to talk to someone. Come one Walmart. Right your wrong! I've been nothing but loyal and have spent a lot of money there over the last few years. Understand I'm not a 16 kid trying to return a game because I beat it.",

I know that Walmart is not Neiman Marcus, but customer service is supposed to do something to leave the customer feeling good about the interaction.

Unfortunately I left empty handed as the item on display that I loved was out of stock. When I spoke to the manager on duty I was told to look online and that they would not be receiving anymore Halloween product. If they've really not going to be receiving anymore then why have the display up still. I was told I could not by the display in case they got more. 🤔 I was then told to check online. No offer to check other stores. No offer to check online for me. Not even a sorry. So I still really wanted this item. So I checked online. Out of stock. I started a chat with customer service to try to find out if the item would even be back in at all. They did not know. However she did find a store within an hour that had the item. I saw online where it store had multiples in stock. So I placed the order online to pick up the following day. The next day I received and email stating the order was canceled! They apparently were out of stock! This makes no sense. Do they not pull the orders when you place an order?! Apparently not. So I contact customer service again. No help and short service. I was told the item is not in stock and to see go up to get a notice IF the item comes back in. So no one is understanding my frustration that the order was canceled when they had the product when the order was placed. I realize that it is out of stock now. Today. But it was not when I placed my order. I was willing to drive near an hour to give Walmart my business and they couldn't be bothered to pull my order.The chat representative made no attempt to search if other stores that may have it. This is unacceptable and rude service. Still I have not received a genuine offer of help finding the product. I am done with Walmart. Please tell your friends and family. I know I intend to.",

Upon arriving home, I researched and found that Allegra D does not have the same effectiveness for what I have as the Mucinex.  I sent back and got the Mucinex, but they would not take back the Allegra, saying they told me that once I purchased it, it could not be returned.  BALD FACED LIE!!! If they had told me that, I would have done the research there, before I purchased, but, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE SAME! Bottom line, they did not tell me that it could not be returned and no where on the receipt did it say that it could not be returned, and NO WHERE on the website is that policy stated. That is a BIG TIME Fraudulent, Non WRITTEN. Non VERBALIZED POLICY, that the customers have to find out after the fact.  I could see if it had been days of the purchase, but it was within 30 MINUTES!!! You All need to rectify that.  If that is the case, you need to have it posted because your employees are not communicating that fact to the customers!!!",

I thought I'll try one more time, I placed my order, then realized they couldn't complete the order that day so I canceled it. I went to Walmart and spent $200 on Grocery's for my family, then look at my account today and I was charged for the order I cancelled. 7-10 business days to return my money. Thanks Walmart this is the last time I will ever shop at Walmart, I will be spreading the news via internet. Not once has Walmart made anything ever right with its customers. I'll spend more money at Fred Meyers, Winco, and Albertsons. Plus I know that Walmart leaves there uncooked whole chickens sitting in the back with flys all over them before they even cook them. One of the most dirtiest delis and meat sections compared to your competitors. I have pics of what your deli looks like when they actually clean it. Which is what once a year???  Black mold, mildew, mice, mice crap. Walmart you a joke!!",

If you just purchase a voltage tester verify that the voltage tester Works before you turn the power off and then check to make sure that the power is off  after the circuit breakers turned off!    If the voltage tester is defective and you turn off the wrong circuit breaker you could get an electric shock.  Please correct this!",

Yesterday as I was leaving a local store, tired, I was accosted by a woman who claimed to know me (never saw her before) claiming to be collecting money for a child with sickle cell/leukemia. I had none, she was quite rude and I reported her to the store as a beggar. As I drove towards the exit, having passed the crosswalk, two Walmart employees were apparently taking extra time crossing. Deliberately. Looking at me grinning. In their WALMART vests. Already tired and irritated from the previous encounter I gave a brief toot of the horn. Of course I got a dirty look. Accompanied by \"punk a** b**ch!\" She and her companion have been reported. This store is needed but it won't last long like this.",

I got my car back very quickly too quickly I thought at the time.  I got in my car a couple of hours later by now it was dark.  I noticed that my lights were very dim I couldn't see.  I went back to my Aunts and opened the hood of my car to see if I could adjust the angle a bit.  To my surprise the bulb was just dangling there and the not held in place.  It was also missing one of the two plastic pieces that plug into the bulb and the V spring that holds the assembled pieces in place.  The other light was the same way.  I went back to the store but the automotive department was closed.  I explained the situation and took her out to my car to show her the issue.  I said to her that having replaced the bulbs myself always before that I knew exactly what was wrong and exactly what pieces were missing.  I asked if I could please look in the trash for the missing pieces as I would fix it myself but that fell on deaf ears.  I was told that she didn't have time to resolve my issue tonight as she had to watch a video.  She would have the manager of the Automotive department call me in the morning.  I said my biggest concern is that I need the pieces back to my car.  Now they have to review security camera tapes and such.  I guess I must just be making this up.  Not to mention the fact that when I went to place the lightbulb back how it was the tip exploded.  Now I am trapped 1300 miles away from home with a car that is now a safety hazard.

The same goes for single women and mothers with children,\n\nIts time to step up to the plate and start providing 24 hour real security (Armed and trained) for the protection of your customers as you have opened yourself wide open to civil liabilities as its a well know fact around town that your parking lot is not a relatively safe one",

I've never been overwhelmed by Walmarts customer service which is fine. It's always  good enough until now. If you cant be bothered with customer service peraps you sould re think your foray into mail order. Again companies like Amazon have set the bar too high. Evidently way too high for your company.

Well yesterday I went to Walmart to purchase some groceries one item was a bag of grapes. I had decided to eat a handful that night not thinking anything of it but my lips were tingling probably an hour after I ate them. I woke up at about 1am to a swollen top lip. I always wash my fruit thoroughly because of cleanliness and the use of pesticides. I called the corporate office in which I was instructed to go back to Walmart to return the grapes. I also stated to them I missed a day from work due to a swollen lip and I was instructed to talk to the store manager. I did as I was instructed and went to the customer service counter to explain my issues to the assistant manager who was very nice and did offer a refund of my purchase. I then ask to speak with the store manager to discuss the issue and she was so nonchalant about the entire situation. She walk up to me and stated\" Hi I'm the manager\" I explained to her what happened and that I missed a day of work because of my swollen lip. She then stated \" Well Walmart cant pay you for missing a day of work\" I then replied\" It was probably the pesticides on the fruit\". She stated\" we don't use pesticides and I replied yes all fruits are sprayed with pesticide. She then stated\" Well that had nothing to do with Walmart and I replied \" Yes Walmart is selling the grapes. She then stated \" You have to prove it\" She asked\" Do you have a medical history? Are you healthy? She was giving me the third degree. She was so unprofessional and no apology was ever made to me. I felt like I was in a confrontation with her the entire time so I ask for her first and last name then walked away frustrated.",

I contacted customer service and they gave me the number to call Overstock. I called them on 9/8 and they said there was a connection error between Walmart and them and they didnt get some orders and mine was one of them, they said they would push it through and that it would take a couple days. My order was still showing processing on 9/12 so I called again. I was told the same thing just that it is taking longer than they anticipated. Look again today, still processing so I called again. They said the same thing, its been nearly 3 weeks since I ordered it. I get told the same thing everytime I call. They said some orders are getting cancelled and some are getting pushed through. This was a comforter set that my son picked out for his 8th birthday for his new bed and his birthday has already past. I am tired of waiting. I was told that I cant cancel the order with Walmart but when I talked to Overstock they couldnt cancel the order either. So my order is being held hostage and so is my credit card. I am fed up, I want something done! If the retailers you sell for can't keep up their end on customer service then you shouldn't sell their stuff!",

They are doing this by allowing their property to be used by Solon Pre-owned cars sales and giving them access to their parking lot. Solon has mailed out 1000's of \"Money Carlo\" flyers claiming to award $20,000.00, $10,000.00, $5000.00 in prizes. A search online finds that the \"Money Carlo\" scam is being used all over the country to trick unsuspecting people into visiting these sales events. All the cards have a wining \"777\" combination displayed in the 2nd position. These are not wining cards, the text is misleading. You have to match the confirmation number on the card to win. If you received one of these pieces please post your reaction on this site and contact the Store Manager to let him know it is violation of trust to support this kind of financial violence against his customers. It is nothing less than a \"Bait & Switch\" scam that was outlawed years ago. I personally am seriously disappointed in Platte Wal-Mart management for this kind of betrayal.

If no assistance is provided, please email me back and I will escalate this to management in order for the necessary actions to be taken and provide resolution as fast as possible. I'll be waiting for your response in order to proceed accordingly.\n \nThank you very much for your patience and understanding.\n \nHave a great day Bill!\n \nSincerely,\n \nJoseph S.\n \nWalmart.com Customer Care\n \nCustomer email (09/19/2016 08:20 AM)\n \nJoseph,\n \nI had called the store first!!! - Was only told that the order had been picked up! Call transferred - hung up on!\nSecond I went to the store and spoke to a manager and was told to contact walmart.com\nNow you tell me to call the store!\n\nDoes Walmart care if an online order gets to the people who ordered it?\n\nBill Woodward   \n\nFrom: Walmart Customer Care <help@walmart.com>\nTo: woodwardwk@yahoo.com\nSent: Monday, September 19, 2016 8:41 AM\nSubject: A response to your Walmart.com inquiry [Who picked up my order?]\n\n \nResponse email (09/19/2016 07:41 AM)\nHi William,\n \nThank you for contacting Walmart.com. I’m glad to be of assistance. Please accept my apology for any inconvenience this may have caused. Darlene I need to explain that store orders and dotcom order are two separate lines of business and due to this reason I can't know who picked up an order although I can provide the store contact number so you can call the store and for the store to provide a straight answer to your question. You may contact the store at Ph. (631) 752-8768.\n \nThank you very much for your understanding William!\n \nHave a great day!\n \nSincerely,\n \nJoseph S.\n \nWalmart.com Customer Care",

Since they don't make those speakers any more what is the chance they will ship my speakers if they are receiving orders at the higher price. You can take them off your website, that's not limited.

If you want the customers to shop there then do the flipping restocking at night instead of clogging up the aisles during the day in the food section. What, is it too hard to actually make those high dollar employees actually work or better still is it that hard to make the managers do their job? You have enough crap set up in the middle of the aisle's which no one seems to want but still can't the shelves be restocked as other Walmart's in the area have done. Why is this store so dirty and so unorganized? OH, I know, it's strictly due to the managers not doing their job. I have read that Walmart is moving some of the people out of the office section and putting them on the floor, well let's just see if they see what a mess that this store has become! If Walmart wants the customers to go to another store then all you have to do is say so, then let's see who will purchase your items that is never on the shelves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I love the fabric department in my local store, but in most cases it is like pulling teeth to get anyone to cut fabric. No one hardly ever is in that department even though they are qualified to cut fabric. When someone with the store finally walks by and asks if you need help, they call on the little phone and it usually takes anywhere from 5-20 minutes for someone to show up, during this time several other associates come by, some asking if I need help and some just on their way to the back of the store. Then when they do show up, guess what? The scanner for the bar code on the fabric and the little computer that prints the label out for the register is missing. Someone from another part of the store during another shift has taken it and didn't return it. I have even had associates to suggest that I come back another day, as they don't have the equipment to help me. I also have had a person get angry at me and inform me that that wasn't their department and suggest that this was interfering with their job.                                                  I think someone needs to be in that department during regular business hours and that any equipment in that department should be left exclusively for that department. Like I said from the start, I love the fabric and craft department. It has been wonderful to go there while shopping in the store anyway, and for the most part, the associates are very apologetic for the long wait and they are helpful or are trying to get me help. Why are there not enough scanners and such for each employee? And why is there no associate to just handle the fabric department? Just want to know.",

I'm intrigued by people, organizational behavior, consumer behavior, etc. Obviously, Wal-Mart has a model that works and made it the largest retailer in the world. However, I've never managed to be impressed with the customer service I've received at any location I've ever been other than one time about 2 years ago in my home city. Tonight, that all changed. I know that many hours and dollars are spent in training and developing the staff and the difficulties in retail. I say all that to say that, tonight my expectations were completely blown away by Mr. Hamid @ Store # 3388 Sugarloaf. He went above and beyond to find what we were looking for and despite our overlooking it. He found the items and called us back to sporting goods over the store intercom. Because of his help and enthusiasm, we bought extra items for gifts that we didn't intend. I would hope even if I don't get a response that at the very least this gentleman receives a congratulations from store management for a job well done! All retailers not just Wal-Mart could use quite a few more Mr. Hamid's on their team. \n\nSincerely,\n\nChris B.",

We called the company right away only to have a hassel and have to do everything through email and we've yet to hear back from them we r on day 2. So the issues besides the table being broken we never received our chairs the table was a completely different table yes it may have been tge same color the table i ordered was suppose to be 64 inches long the one that arrived broken was only 48 inches ok maybe an honest mistake but if u further read the info on the table it states it comes with the table and 4 chairs but is clearly being advertised as a 7 piece set now im no mathematician but 4+1=5 not 7. So last night i was doing some further investigation the chairs r sold separate from the table and nowhere on the ad does it say sold separately. Now thats false advertising at its finest. Come on walmart ur a billion dollar company yet u falsely advertise merchandise then make it next ti impossible to get ur money back. Never again will i order from walmart.com . So upset that yall do business this way 300 dollars for a broken piece of crap table and no chairs. Ill post a pic in the comments of what i ordered. Well i guess i cant post a pic.",

We took it back, a considerable chore because he lives about a 20 minute drive from the store.  The staff was very helpful, from the time we asked for help to get the giant screened monster from the car to the store, to actually helping us check the screen on the replacement TV.  Shaun, who works the returns desk, and Carl, one of the men who helped us wrestle the TV back into the car, and a tall, blond haired gentleman, whose name I didn't catch, we're both awesome and very pleasant.  Now,you'd think this was the end of the story, but you'd be wrong.  When we got the TV home, we noticed that the new TV was missing the remote.  Smart TVs don't work well without those. So since it was late, we called the store and told them about the missing remote.  They said they would get the one from the original TV and save it for him to pick up the next morning.   He did just that, only to discover that it was a remote to a different brand of TV.  Well, to save him from having a stroke from irritation, I went in to get the right remote.  A woman named Brittany was very helpful. Now, I would love to see the people named get some kind of atta boyfriend their efforts. They all went above and beyond to solve our crazy, giant, smart TV problems.",

This past week I discovered that I was missing approximately $25 in merchandise after I finished unpacking my groceries at home. I returned to the store with my receipt only to be told that there was nothing in \"the book\" listing those items as left behind at a checkout.(Which means the next customer got my left behind bag and it was not reported). I was then told \"she\" would look at the video of that checkout lane and try to see what had happened to those missing items, but it would take a while to look. I did a bit of shopping then returned to the customer service desk to be informed that the video showed the customer put the bag containing the items in their cart. Since I'm the customer in question and I obviously do not have the items, I find that very hard to believe. I was not shown the video, I just had to accept what they said, and I have no idea if they even looked at a video. I had no recourse but to walk away empty handed and out $25. I always ask the cashier if I have everything before I leave the checkout, as I did that day, but still missing items.",

I then explained to her that she gave my pouch away to someone else gina then stated oh well its nothin i van do about it she described it so i gave it to her very rude and nonchalant attitude i became upset thinking now that she gave away my pouch with my id money amex among other important cards with my name on them and she dont even act like she cares. I then asked if she was gonna call someone to help or at least attempt to see who she gave my pouch to she didnt even see if any info matched. She then called Gale who kinda tried to help i explained what happened told her how rude the rep was she asked me questions  and gina questions gina didnt even know what color clothing the lady had on she gave my pouch to all she knew was she was tall and white so then lost prevention was called to check footage i called the police since they stated was the only way for me to find out what was on footage. Police explained how she watched them take to customer service and then claimed it which i tried to tell gina that was probably how she caimed it even before the police told me that. I am very upset and disappointed and my issue is not resolved and i am highly not happy with walmart i feel something should be done i called corporate and was told someone would contact me in 3 to 5 business days which is crazy for something this sensitive should be rectified soon as possible. I will keep escalating this issue until someone takes it seriously your associate gave my pouch to the wrong person and i feel walmart should be held accountable",

I was put on hold for 10 minutes and disconnected.  I called back and asked to speak to a manager.  After 15 more minutes on hold, I disconnected myself.  In the meantime, the tire was physically brought to the store only to be told that the auto section was closed.  I called a third time and demanded to speak to the store manager on duty.  I again waited (this time a mere five minutes) and my call was finally answered by Chris, who identified himself as both the automotive manager and the store manager on duty.  He apologised and seemed polite; I explained myself and asked to know what he would do to correct the situation.  He said he would look into the hold times.  He did not offer anything tangible to me, nor did I request it, as the original situation could not be resolved anyway.  But 25+ minutes on hold is unacceptable, and both your receptionist and store supervisors need education regarding the importance of answering calls in a timely manner.",

I went through the store and collected my items and went to check out. I got to the register and the cashier Tracy started to ring me up. When she was done my total came to 81.36 and I ran my debit card and it was declined. I tried again a few times and even ran it as credit and it was still declined. At this point my face was really red and Tracy asked if I had another form of payment to which I replied I didn't. I told her I just started working again and I got my first check on Friday and put it into my new bank account and all of the funds must not be available yet. I told her I'll have to put everything back and come back tomorrow if my funds are available. At that point Tracy walked around the cashiers stand and pulled her card out of her pocket and told me just come back to repay me when you can. I refused again and again and she insisted on doing it for me. I thanked her profusely and told her I would probably be back tomorrow once my money in my bank account is available. She said don't worry I'm here all of the time and you come back when you can. I walked out almost in tears. We always hear these type of good stories on social media and in the news these days but I never thought in a million years that I would be on the receiving end of those good deeds. I want to thank Tracy from the bottom of my heart. Walmart your cashier went above and beyond today with her customer service and she deserves recognition. Tracy has restored my faith in Walmart!!",

First with a return of the wrong cable, then with the return of a piece of garbage stud finder that wouldnt turn on with the brand new batteries also from walmart. Each return resulted in a long non moving line in a store with no working AC, loud inappropriate music blasting in customer service and a SINGLE cashier processing returns despite the dozen other employees lingering around. I simply loathe walmart with every ounce of my being and they turned an easy project into an all day affair. Consider me a target shopper for the rest of my life. #ihatewalmart",

I take it to Walmart and present that release form to the rep at the photo center. GUESS WHAT! That wasn’t good enough. Your customer service rep decided that there was once again a potential copyright violation. \n\nWhat makes this funny is that you have printed images from Google images for me that had an artist’s signature on the image itself.

But what if, by chance, they are ready for pick-up very fast and I arrive after the seven days limit for pick up? Can I ask the local store to keep my order a few days longer for me?\n\nThanks and greetings",

I've asked for an update and all I get is that they're still picking items (I get they don't want to give a time frame and be wrong). I can understand the frustration with your employees right now as I'm sure there is good reason to be backed up. However, a call to notify that they are delayed and given my a new to time to pickup or called when nearly ready would have saved me a lot of trouble and my time. There is a certain level of expectation and convenience factor with a service such as this. Something has to be done to improve your service and customer support.",

Saturday comes and long and behold the order wasn't fulfilled. A simple sorry, really!!!!! My husband was told to wait several times as they got one manager, then a higher manager, so forth and so on. After an hour, still no resolution and no cake for my daughters bday. Its so exhausting and emotionally stressful when your child has picked a cake for her party and finds out it is not made. Also because of Walmart, our party was at a venue, and by the time we finally did get a cake, we had to rush the kids to eat it as our time was limited. Walmart put a major damper on my child's birthday. It is my duty to inform every consumer of the stupidity, lack of responsibility, compassion and professionalism Walmart is now become. A simple sorry does not suffice!!!!!",

I find it very aggravating that when you use a coupon you have to argue with the CSM at our Walmart as to why that coupon  is the correct one for the product then they tell me \"this says one per product\" so you can only use one. That is not true unless it says one per transaction or per household per day. I really feel that if someone is going to tell me how to use my coupons that they at least know themselves how to use them!!! There are also couponing classes that can help with this! Also, they should know that if it doesn't look like the picture you have to read the coupon to see if it excludes the product being purchased. We spend a lot of time buying, clipping, and organizing our coupons in an effort to save a few dollars! I don't see anyone questioning people about their food stamps that our tax dollars pay for and yet my coupons cost none of you a dime! 😡 Thank goodness that I don't have to shop here!

There were leg weights,jump ropes, and free weights, (some up to 45 lbs) and weight bars, all remarkably marked down to 1.00 also. I managed to get a few things. But before I could get some of the weights and weight bars, a sales associate whisked them away and put them under their register. Another associate two two of the large outdoor sprays and walked away with them I do believe they were not on break, and feel they should not be able to stash items away later for their purchase. They should be put out for customers. What is your policy on this? Are associates allowed to shop and \"stash\" on company time?",

            "message": "Your Oak St Brockton MA location is the absolute worst in the world. Customer service & management are awful as well. I went to the 20 or less line with 6 items & waited 10 minutes while the customer in front of me had over 60 items. As if that weren't bad enough, when they went to pay with their EBT card, the payment was not being accepted so I, along with the line of 10 people behind me stood for another 10 minutes (total of 20 mins at this point) while the cashier & non-English speaking customers slid their card a million more times. Why did the rest of us customers not move to another line you ask? Maybe because there were only 5 registers total open at the store with lines equally as long. I pointed out to the cashier that the customer had over 60 items & he laughed and said \"Maybe.\" I didn't see the humor. Customers behind me also said the same thing to him, but received the same response. So as we all waited for him to call management, we requested that he suspend their order so the rest of us could pay for our LESS THAN 20 items & be on our merry way. He said he couldn't do that.  So at that point I had to choose to either stand in that line for another 10 minutes or switch lines & pray that that new line would move. (I found a new line & the cashier was nice & worked fast). While waiting, I called the store & asked to speak to a manager. The person who finally came on claiming to be a manager was awful. He did not seem to care that his staff wasn't doing their job correctly. I suggested that perhaps they should have opened another register (since there were about 8 unopened) for those of us who had been waiting in line rather than forcing us to go wait in a new long line. He didn't seem to care and was arguing with me. So with this, I'd like to say F*ck you Walmart & your Brockton location. I will NEVER spend another dime at your stores. I knew there was a reason to only shop at Target. \nYour Brockton MA location is dirty & has poor management. I'll never shop your stores again & I hope others will also soon see what a terrible company you are.",

Dropped off a written prescription yesterday, told the person I would be back to pick it up. 45 minutes later, after shopping, I checked on the prescription and they said it was still being worked on (though I observed two people in the pharmacy standing there talking and not working on prescriptions). I was polite, told them I'd be back today to get it then.\nSent my husband to pick it up thinking it should be no problem, he's told they have no idea what he's talking about an when he argued that he saw me drop it off, he was basically cut off and told they couldn't help him further. Oh, and also it was their lunchtime so if he wanted to stand there and wait until they got back then they could pursue it but they had to go to lunch. Are you kidding?! Who treats customers like that? It's great when you get the prescription discounts that Walmart gives but obviously it comes with a greater price. \nThe biggest thing is that basically I was lied to yesterday when I went to check on my prescription an told they were working on it when in all actuality they had done nothing. How many other customers are lied to on a daily basis?",

It was posted on line at my local Wapakoneta, Ohio store for $328.00... I called the electronics department to see if it was in stock, the clerk said Yes. I called back with in 5 minutes because I found the Walmart was selling the exact same TV online for $298.00, the same clerk said thay I'd have to bring proof in the form of a print out, or a picture, and they would Comp the price. So I sent my son to pick it up, he had the picture on his phone. But, he forgot to show it at the time of the transaction. So I called again, this time I talked with the head register clerk or something, Ms. Cheyenne. My son drove the 10 miles back to the store, but Ms. C. couldn't find it on line, so no deal/ no refund of $30 plus tax. So I told my son, come get the TV and take it back for a full refund. So, I just take my money and buy it elsewhere!\nHere's the link to the sale page that Ms. C. didn't take the time to look for, and caused us all the problem!\n\n",

August 29th a chat with \"Abner C\" assured me he'd contacted overstock/walmart through his channels and I should be hearing from them 24-48 hours.  Nothing.  Somewhere around September 6th I called overstock/walmart.  Very nice young man informed me that it was never received by overstock, was stuck in walmart processing.  He couldn't directly transfer me, but would make sure the appropriate department was notified and would take care of it that day.  That day I finally got an email response to the note I'd sent on August 27th, promising resolution in 24-48 hours.  That was it. September 13th I chatted with walmart again.  This time Karen S. told me that since I'd already done all this, she would forward it to a higher department and I should see resolution in... you guessed it... 24-48 hours.   It's now September 17 and STILL stuck in processing with no further contact.  It seems that noone can tell me anything... they just keep passing it off.    There's no excuse for this anymore.  Somebody figure out how to fix this.  Get some customer service reps who do more than pass it off and make promises that no one is keeping.

It was a plastic cylindrical container from Tub O’Toys that contained 9 “squeezable, teethable animal pals” for babies age 0+. When we got home I opened the container and let my daughter play with the toys. I initially took each individual toy to show to my daughter to teach her the name of each animal and did not notice anything unusual. Each toy has a small hole in its face that you can squeeze air through. I was playing with my daughter and squeezing air out of the hole in one of the toys to my daughter’s face when I noticed something shinny protruding from the toy she was playing it. I immediately took it from her and found a small hollow metal thing sticking out of the hole in the mouth of the light green frog. That metal thing must have popped out of the hole when my daughter was playing with it. I took it out and to my great shock it was half of a broken hypodermic needle with a large and sharp tip. This is extremely upsetting to us. I immediately took some photos and also sent a complaint to Walmart website (there is no function for uploading photos there) but have not heard back from them. What if I or my daughter got stuck with this needle? Who know whether it has contaminated with any disease! The number right below the bar code is 73554 06763 (don’t know if this is a lot number). How are you going to ensure this does not happen again to other children playing with toys from the same company? How are you going to rectify the situation? What is your corrective plan of action? As parents of course we take these things very seriously. As a physician, I am even more upset because of the knowledge that possible harm/disease could be transmitted to my daughter had I not taken the toy away from her. I hope you (Walmart) take this matter seriously and I demand a prompt explanation/answer from you.",

I look at said receipt and realized that they were charging me $428. So I went back to the same person to get it fixed no big deal. To do this they had to have a manger approval. No big deal. After waiting about 20 minutes mins the manger finally shows up and is rude before any one had a chance to explain things. She looks at the sign says the sign is wrong and they will not honor the price. She then starts to walk off like that was it. I then said excuse mean but I would like to have the layaway canceled because the tv is $100 more then advertised. She then got really huffy and rude.

I would like to exchange it and receive a refund for this disaster if an experience as well, as I now have to have my room bombed for bed bugs. As far as I've been told and known it is against store policy to sell a used and returned blow up bed.  I bought this brand new online and had it ordered to pick up.  The stains on it I'm almost positive are dried semen, dirt, and god knows what else.  It also deflates almost immediately after being blown up. I'm disgusted, what if I was vision impaired and didn't see the stains and put my children on a bed covered in somebody's bodily fluids? I'm appalled.  Please make this right. You can refer to my personal page where I posted 22 pictures of the bed and my order and the disgusting condition it's in. Thanks.",

No Show no phone call, around 6 P,M wife called was put on hold for over a hour. Finally got a hold of someone, lady on the other end said, they couldn't find anyone to fix it wife asked then why did you tell me someone would come out to fix it she said we will try to find someone. No call for days, then some one called and asked if she could send a picture so she did, then another call guy came out took a picture, repair man sated that the inside TV screen had flause in them any little bump and they would crack. said he would get back to us, no call back wife called hin he said Samsung would not fix it. So now I am without my over $400 and no TV, They need to bring back TVs that don't break or when you buy a 3 year warranty it should be covered.

The gel inside was all clumped up but still plyable. The pad itself was not damaged in anyway, including the wings and the backside still having the paper on them which I peeled off and stuck it to my finger. Still worked! Picked it up off the ground having it stuck to just one finger! \n\nI know this isn't a real life scenario that women should be concerned with normally when picking products, but if you break the situation down and think about what it was able to with-stand with out ripping to shreds or loosing it's ability to remain adhesive, I think it's a pretty good indication of what this pad can with-stand in normal life. \n\nI've included pictures in the comments!",

They didn't have several of the items we were looking for but the Walmart in another town did. I looked online but could not find anything that said whether or not we could make payments at another store. The only thing I found said that the last payment and pickup had to be done at the store the layaway was initiated...which makes it sound like payments could be done at any store. We called our local store and customer service told us that we could initiate layaway at one store but make payments at another. Great! So we went to another town and did the layaway. As they were ringing stuff up, my husband again brought up that we would be making payments at a different store and we were told \"That will be fine as long as the last payment and pickup is done here.\" \n\nSo today we go to make our first payment at our local store and guess what...now we are being told that we can't do that and we must drive out of town to make each payment. We told her that we can't do that and that both stores told us it would be no problem and she shrugged and said \"Sorry. You can cancel but you'll have to pay a fee.\"\n\nCome on. This is ridiculous.

My son is really into science and technology, but we have such a hard time finding clothes for him. I recently got him an Einstein shirt. They only had it in men's sizes, so I got the smallest one. It's pretty big on him, but he still loves it. I would love to see more kids sizes for boys and girls. Also more super hero shirts for girls. I know you have some, but more is always better. :) My daughter loves super heroes. And ninja turtles!",

Tonight I experienced the worst customer service ever. This \"customer service manager\" in Walmart escorted my wife and I out because we got a bike down and sat on it. Didn't even ride the bike around! This lady followed us around and after we asked what was the matter she said in her radio \"no they are not drunk.\" Just because my wife and I are young looking that doesn't give you the right to assume we are drunk and up to no good. My biggest issue with everything is the fact that she couldn't provide a response to why she was following us even after we asked!! Her explanation for that was: oh someone was talking in my earpiece. How about I am the customer and your are the CUSTOMER service manager. There is no reason to follow us around and supervise us like we are some criminals. Then when we finally got to talking to the assistant manager - he was just as incompetent and defended this lady. He told us we were a danger to kids riding the bikes!! At 11:30 at night??? Get out. He also told us he was allowed to follow anyone around the store he wanted. I don't know if that's true or not but having your customer service manager to be 2 feet behind us in the sharpie isle?? Ridiculous! \n\nHere's the issue: once you find out we aren't drunk and not causing problems she should be able to say okay I just wanted to make sure you weren't causing any trouble, have a good night! It's sad we live in a world where college kids have better customer service than 40 and 50 year old adults. I'm done with Walmart and their terrible customer service! Sorry for this post - I've just never been this pissed off at anyone.\n\nTyler Souza Jamie Souza",

It is sad and hopefully not indicative of Walmart Corporate policy.\n\n \nJes Zoe Grobman\n10 hrs · Northampton, MA · \nPLEASE SHARE WIDELY: TRANSPHOBIC DISCRIMINATION AT WALMART\nI just had one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life at the Walmart in Northampton, Massach...usetts. I was going to pick up a money transfer from my father. I don't currently have an ID because I'm waiting to get my new Massachusetts license in the mail, but I was given a security question I could answer instead, so it was no big deal.\nFrom the beginning I was met with extreme hostility from Nilsa, who identified herself as the customer service manager. She refused to allow me to use the security question and when I explained what I was told she told me to \"calm down sir\". Now I sometimes dress very androgynous, but today I was wearing a femme top with a bra and a long skirt - I was as passing as I've ever been in my life. When I told her that I am a woman she once again called me \"sir\". When I asked. her why she is calling me sir she responded \"why would I call you anything else?\" And added \"I was trying to be polite\", as if being actively transphobic and refusing to recognize my gender - which I have legally changed to Female, not like it should matter - is an honor I should be thanking her for.\nIt was only after I insisted that transphobic discrimination was illegal in Massachusetts that she called her manager who - surprise surprise - told me I was allowed to answer the security question and gave me my money.\nI went through an incredibly humiliating and public act of transphobic violence solely because a supervisor decided to ignore her own stores rules in order to have an excuse to hassle and harass a visibly disabled trans woman. It's shit like this that makes me afraid to exist in public. We can't let the bigots prevent trans women from accessing public space. Feel free to call the Northampton Walmart at (413) 587-0001 and let them know that transphobia will not be tolerated",

I came into the store hoping to get better results and there was literally no long lines in the store which mean she lied to me she just didn't want to do her job!

Our checkout girl was Amie.  For reference, I want you to know that my daughter had gone and gotten us each a bag of Cheetos.  \nShe was checking out in front of me, so I heard the entire conversation.  \nShe asked Amie what the price was on the Cheetos and she checked the tape and said something like $2.78.  My daughter told her they were in 2 places on the shelf, one for $2.78, and the other for $2.50, so she had picked the packages from the $2.50 section.   Amie said, \"So?\"\nMy daughter said she would like them for $2.50.  Amie said, \"What do you want me to do about it??\"  My daughter said she would like a price correction.... Amie said \"No\".  \nMy daughter stated that they do price matching all the time..... Amie just stood there.  My daughter asked her to take them off her bill, she would purchase them elsewhere.  I handed her my package when it was my turn to check out.\nWe get home and my Safeway ad has them for $1.99!!\nWe would gladly have paid the $2.50 at Wal-Mart, but the attitude was totally unacceptable.\nWhat has happened to common decency?

I redid your feedback through the \"proper\" channels, and have not heard a word from you. So I will continue boycotting your store. I will also continue encouraging others to do the same. Perhaps my story did not matter to you, but it did matter to my in-laws, who when visiting decided to go to Kroger instead after hearing about my experience. \n\nYou make good wings... when they aren't under cooked by a staff changed daily. Maybe you should consider apologizing to me at the very least.\n\nUntil then... do not shop at Wal-Mart. I won't. My wife and I will happily pay extra to be at Kroger or HEB. \n\nAll I wanted was chicken wings, I was there at the hours they were open, and your manager was rude to me for being upset that they closed early. Make this right.\n\nLike · Reply · Just now",

My mother said she would donate and then asked why the cashier didn't ask if she wished to donate.   The cashier's reply: \"After two weeks,  most people say no when we ask,  so we just stopped asking for donations. \".  \nThis is unacceptable to someone who has children,  or to anyone at all who likes to help others.   I don't care if you say no,  or if you donate money.  You should get the option.   Laziness on the part of these cashiers hurts children.. And that is unacceptable.   \n\n#WalMart #ChildrensMiracleNetwork #helpkids",

How could you show items available online, take my money through an order, and then when I go to pick up from the store, I'm told they don't carry those items. I was told by TWO employees that your online site is NEVER synced with what is actually available in stock, and I'm now stuck needing TWENTY FOUR items for my daughters birthday this Sunday, with nowhere else to get it from on time. I trusted I would have my items ready for a local pickup, therefor did not order from another online site, and now I'm stuck. #fixtheproblem",

Once I received it, I found that it was incompatible with our Mac.  I contacted the seller and explained it did not work with some of my Mac programs.  They told me they will refund my purchase after I send back the keyboard.  I requested a return label with return shipping paid for by them but they refused.  I contacted Walmart, because, after all, the item is advertised as “universal” on the Walmart.com website.  Walmart did not acknowledge any responsibility.  I am very disappointed at the service because the shipping cost is almost the price of the item.  So I am stuck with a purchase I cannot use.  I feel Walmart should be responsible because customers rely on what is written on the website.  I am very disapointed! at Walmart!",

            "message": "To whom this may concern...\nI recently ordered tires through my  paypal aacount  on 8/24/2016 through walmart.com.  I called the Walmart near me to make sure that you had the tires I needed in stock.  You did. So I went to get the tires put on my car, but the manager Freddy said that I could not get my tires that day even though they were in stock. That i would have to wait two weeks to have them shipped then I could have them put on. I dont think he really wanted to help me. That was not an option for me because at the moment  I had two really bad tires. I needed them that day. So I had to pay cash for the tires in the store. Plus I bought  a new battery.  While I just spent $417.00 in your store for new tires and a battery, I am waiting on my car, and another manger approaches me named Shelly begins to accuse me of panhandling in her store in front of other customers and proceeds to have me removed from the store. Mind you im still waiting on my car to be fixed. I asked where did she hear that from. She said two other employees that were there informed her of that. Of course I asked who and she would not disclose that info to me.I was completely humiliated in front of several customers!!!! Then she finds out this is not true and never once apologized to me!!!!!!! On top of this I cancelled my order through paypal the same day. Here it is is 3 weeks later after 5 different times of contacting your  customer service department for my refund, and I still have not received my refund.  If you check your records. You will see I contacted you on  8/26, 8/31, 9/7,  and 9/13. I am a single mom and work 3 jobs to make ends meet. I have been shopping with you for 25 years THIS IS THE ABSOLUTELY MOST WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I  HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE. I WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK IN TO SHOP IN ANY OF YOUR STORES NOR WILL MY FAMILY. On top of this I keep getting an email that my tires are ready for pick up, so obviously your customer service never cancelled the order.  .So can someone who knows what they are doing figure out how I can get my freaking refund on my account!!  I am beyond pissed at this point and I am tired of contacting your customer service department .  I shouldn't have to pay for the same tires twice, and after what I have experienced in store and with your managers and the customer service department I should get a full refund on the money I spent in your store as well.  Thank you",

            "message": "At least one of the employees at your Camp Hill, PA location would benefit from extensive cultural awareness/sensitivity training. Or at the very least, training on how to differentiate what is and isn't appropriate to say to a customer. Today at 1:34pm I went to register #8 to check out my purchases (receipt ID # 7JZL2T21RN4R). The cashier was an older woman who, although she was very slow with the check out process, seemed the affable type. She spent a lot of time chatting up the customer ahead of me and fawning over the adorable baby she had with her. When my turn came she struck up a conversation with me, as well, commenting on my scrubs and inquiring whether I had just left work or if I was on my way in. During our interaction her eyes kept darting over to the couple behind me. The female was wearing a head scarf and a long gown, the male was in some sort of long, flowing gown as well and they were speaking a foreign language to each other as they loaded their purchases onto the conveyor belt. I felt vaguely uncomfortable at the way the cashier keep pointedly looking at them and then looking at me with a conspiratorial smirk on her face but I convinced myself that I was just imagining things. Imagine my surprise when she leaned in towards me while handing me the receipt and beckoned me closer. I leaned in at her behest and she whispered \"The woman behind you smells like camel piss.\" I could not believe my ears. In my best mommy voice, the one I used on my son when he was a toddler and would something rude, I said \"Well. That was not a very nice thing to say.\"  This woman did not even have the decency to look chagrined. Her response was \"I was just wondering if you smelled it, too. It smells really strong.\" First of all, I didn't smell anything at all. And even if I did, I certainly wouldn't be able to differentiate the smell of camel piss from any other kind of piss because I don't spend my time sniffing and cataloging the different aromas of urine. I can only assume that this was her passive aggressive way of expressing displeasure at their egregious offense of looking and sounding different than her. To be honest, I've become pretty desensitized to racism these days. Every day I see acquaintances of mine posting comments on Facebook that range from mildly racist to flagrantly so, all in the name of \"politics\" and \"patriotism\".  Sometimes I see things that inflame my tender sensibilities, being that I'm a minority myself. But I keep my opinion to myself because everybody has a right to believe in what they want to believe in, right? If this cashier wants to believe that all people in foreign garb speaking a foreign language smell like camel piss, that's her business. But that this woman had the audacity to lean in and whisper this snide remark to a CUSTOMER like I was her BFF sharing some sort of inside joke with her was more than I could bear. I already complained to a supervisor at the store's customer service department who agreed that this cashier's comment was rude and ignorant and who stated she would handle this matter promptly. However, I am offended enough that I feel your corporate offices should know that this took place in one of your stores. I hope that at the very least this woman can get the training she sorely needs so that this may not happen again. Thank you.",

I had locked my keys in my car and was waiting for my husband to bring another set of keys.  I had purchased several cold/frozen items, and I figured they would not tolerate the heat well!  Mr. Dick was outside the store near my car, and it appeared he was leaving for the day.  When he heard me tell someone about being locked out of my car, he immediately asked if I had cold items.  He said they could be stored in a refrigerator at the back of the store, and said he would be glad to take them for me.  When I commented that he must work there because he knows what to do, he told me he was the store manager!  He asked my name and pointed me to a bench inside at the front of the store; he took my cold things to the Customer Service desk where he gave them to a young woman! pointing me out to her.   Then he came to me, told me her name, and said to see her at the CS desk when I was ready to leave.  I did that, she got my things, and I was on my way.  Mr. James Dick is the customer-service-oriented kind of manager that EVERY store should have!",

What kind of customer service is this especially when Walmart is supposedly ramping up your online presence?

I went through a nightmare at the store with this card, and finally I was able to get into my account. After making three purchases - all which were basic purchases in legitimate businesses, I tried to make an online URGENT purchase and my card was declined. I called the customer service number on the back of the card and was transferred to an \"escalations\" department. The obviously foreign woman on the phone informed me that Walmart had put a BLOCK on my money and until I received my personalized card, I would not be able to access my money. My spouse, who has a very long history in customer service and support for corporations, handled this as I was at work. The female continuously refused to get a supervisor and told me I could no access MY MONEY because of the fact that there was suspicious activity. The block was lifted (this was in my email), but apparently someone blocked me AGAIN. When speaking the the foreign woman, she repeatedly refused to escalate my call. When I finally got put on hold, she came back on the phone to tell me that my card could have a temporary lift on the block for TWO MINUTES. Who can pay for medically necessary prescriptions, purchase incredibly important things online that are regarding bills,in TWO MINUTES? And this TWO MINUTES was only given to me because I refused to give up!!! I was also locked out of my online account, which means that even with my TWO MINUTES to hopefully transfer my funds I couldn't do so. I NEED MY MONEY. I AM BEING TOLD THAT WALMART WONT GIVE IT TO ME AND IT IS SEVEN DAYS BEFORE I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK????!!! THAT IS ROBBERY!!! REALLY??? I GAVE ALL OF MY INFO AND YOU STILL BLOCK ME??? Conveniently, the foreigner call was disconnected when I continuously DEMANDED a supervisor. When we called back, obviously we were MAD AT WALMART STEALING OUR MONEY AND ESCALATED. The EXTREMELY apathetic foreign man this time offered no option to get even a two minute lift, refused to put a supervisor on the phone, and when we progressively got more and more ESCALATED trying to GET OUR MONEY the man continued to refuse to escalate us and very flippantly told us that we could feel free to contact corporate but we wouldn't be looking at anything different in terms of getting the money. I am an insulin dependent diabetic who is in need of prescriptions, as well as my wife having LEGAL OBLIGATIONS that she needs to pay and now WALMART WON'T LET US HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. THE CARD WORKED THIS AFTERNOON, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!! I DEMAND SOMEONE CONTACT ME WITH A RESOLUTION IMMEDIATELY AND WILL CONTINUE TO POST IN EVERY ONLINE FORUM UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED. IF I HAVE TO I WILL REPORT THIS TO THE POLICE, THE BBB, AND ANYONE ELSE. YOU DON'T EVEN LET ME LOG IN!!! YOU ARE NOW LIABLE TO POTENTIALLY CREATING A SITUATION THAT COULD HOSPITALIZE ME, MAKE US LATE ON BILLS, AND POTENTIALLY PUT US IN HARMS WAY ON MULTIPLE FRONTS. I DEMAND AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO RESOLVE THIS, AND NOT IN SEVEN DAYS. I NEED MY MONEY. NOW!!!",

            "message": "Walmart in essence is holding $800 of  my money ransom!  This is straight theft!  I have a Walmart money that I loaded TODAY with my full paycheck.  I went through a nightmare at the store with this card, and finally I was able to get into my account.  After making three purchases - all which were basic purchases in legitimate businesses, I tried to make an online URGENT purchase and my card was declined.  I called the customer service number on the back of the card and was transferred to an \"escalations\" department.  The obviously foreign woman on the phone informed me that Walmart had put a BLOCK on my money and until I received my personalized card, I would not be able to access my money.  My spouse, who has a very long history in customer service and support for corporations, handled this as I was at work.  The female continuously refused to get a supervisor and told me I could no access MY MONEY because of the fact that there was suspicious activity.  The block was lifted (this was in my email), but apparently someone blocked me AGAIN.  When speaking the the foreign woman, she repeatedly refused to escalate my call.  When I finally got put on hold, she came back on the phone to tell me that my card could have a temporary lift on the block for TWO MINUTES.  Who can pay for medically necessary prescriptions, purchase incredibly important things online that are regarding bills,in TWO MINUTES?  And this TWO MINUTES was only given to me because I refused to give up!!!  I was also locked out of my online account, which means that even with my TWO MINUTES to hopefully transfer my funds I couldn't do so.  I NEED MY MONEY.  I AM BEING TOLD THAT WALMART WONT GIVE IT TO ME AND IT IS SEVEN DAYS BEFORE I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK????!!!  THAT IS ROBBERY!!!  REALLY???  I GAVE ALL OF MY INFO AND YOU STILL BLOCK ME???  Conveniently, the foreigner call was disconnected when I continuously DEMANDED a supervisor. When we called back, obviously we were MAD AT WALMART STEALING OUR MONEY AND ESCALATED.  The EXTREMELY apathetic foreign man this time offered no option to get even a two minute lift, refused to put a supervisor on the phone, and when we progressively got more and more ESCALATED trying to GET OUR MONEY the man continued to refuse to escalate us and very flippantly told us that we could feel free to contact corporate but we wouldn't be looking at anything different in terms of getting the money.  I am an insulin dependent diabetic who is in need of prescriptions, as well as my wife having LEGAL OBLIGATIONS that she needs to pay and now WALMART WON'T LET US HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT.  THE CARD WORKED THIS AFTERNOON, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!  I DEMAND SOMEONE CONTACT ME WITH A RESOLUTION IMMEDIATELY AND WILL CONTINUE TO POST IN EVERY ONLINE FORUM UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED.  IF I HAVE TO I WILL REPORT THIS TO THE POLICE, THE BBB, AND ANYONE ELSE.  YOU DON'T EVEN LET ME LOG IN!!! YOU ARE NOW LIABLE TO POTENTIALLY CREATING A SITUATION THAT COULD HOSPITALIZE ME, MAKE US LATE ON BILLS, AND POTENTIALLY PUT US IN HARMS WAY ON MULTIPLE FRONTS.  I DEMAND AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO RESOLVE THIS, AND NOT IN SEVEN DAYS.  I NEED MY MONEY.  NOW!!!",

            "message": "Walmart.com is a horrible place to shop online. Now after two times I can say this is a place to shop cheap items(less than $ 50) and not for any thing costly. The customer care is again terrible .I am totally disappointed with the bad shopping experience at walmart.com consecutively two times which enforced me to write my latest experience here.\n\nOn Aug 30th 2016 , I ordered “Buchannan Microfiber Sofa” from walmart.com which cost me around $266.40 (including tax , shipping and handling) .I got an email from walmart.com that the order is placed successfully and it would be delivered by 14th Sept 2016. In my walmart account it also displayed a feedex number to track the order . But unfortunately whenever I tried to track my sofa, it took me to http://walmart.narvar.com/...., where it was mentioned that the order is just shipped. Since it was a heavy weight order , I thought they will update it as it delivers .Anyway, I was very excited to receive the new sofa today so as my family members were . \n\nWith excitement , I called the walmart customer care  to get the update on my sofa which is supposed to be delivered by Today and not yet delivered.  As per the request , I provided my order number to the customer care executive . I really got stunned with his answers . \n\nThe Walmart executive told me , there was a mistake from walmart.com and thats why the order is not yet placed .If I want, he would replace my order without any additional cost charged to me . It was very pathetic and frustrating to hear such kind of statement from the walmart executive. It has already 15 days gone when I placed my order and paid the amount  for the same , and after 15  days they are saying due to their mistake, they have not placed my order although a wrong information is displayed on my walmart account and me and my  family was counting the days and waiting for the day to come when we can get the new sofa.  Again most surprising thing is the customer care executive is saying , he can place a new order without any additional charges / penalty to me (such that I did anything wrong where as the mistake was from their side ) . Since I already waited for 15 days I requested them whether they can provide me a fast shipping so that I can get the sofa in less time (may be within a week) .But the customer care executive told me ,that it would take another 15 days if I place a new order now . I really got upset with the answer of the walmart executive since he told me if I want he can cancel my order within no time, I opted to do that. He cancelled my order and told the money will be refunded within next 5 -7 business days. \n\nThis is not the first time I experienced the bad shopping process and bad customer handling from walmart.com. I had few more experiences as well . But this time it really painful since I waited for 15 days and at the end faced such kind of things . Today I have decided not to order anything in future from walmart.com .",

Im not sure who came up with this ridiculous policy, but if this is in fact true, Meijer, and Amazon just inherited the $1000 or so a month I generally spend at your stores.  I would love for anyone to explain the logic of this to me, if I was buying for an underage person, and knew your policy, I would either not enter the checkout line with them, or leave them in the car, what's next? Video surveillance of every alcohol purchasing Cx from the moment they enter the store until purchase?  Will there be employees checking our vehicles before approving the sales?  Perhaps employees following us home, to watch us drink it. I'm sure whoever came up with this, was patting themselves on the back thinking they were making some sort of difference, to curb underage drinking, when in fact the only thing this policy does is fool the uninformed, and logically challenged into feeling better about themselves, (without comprehending it makes absolutely no difference at all, except to inconvenience your legal age  \"previous\" patrons.",

Well it had me worried what it was because made in china. I asked them to cut it open to see what it was and they refused. We argued a little and i got my money back. Well manufacturer called me back about it and i told them what i had done and they asked why did they not cut it open to see what it was. I told them manager said it wasnt his job along with other employees. What kind of a place is walmart running when they dont care about the welfare of there customers. I hope with all of the crazy things going on in this world there was nothing harmful to me or my son in that. Seems like big box store might care a little more. How many other things are carrying foreign objects in them that they sell. Buyer beware of walmart.

I was working for Walmart on August, 2015, where the building filled with CO2. If I had not demanded that the par medics be called because of chest pains and short breath, then we would have all been dead. While in the hospital I had visits from an asst. manager, once, two visits from a dist. Manager, and four visits from the store manager. My family was called several times from an asst. manager the morning that this happened.\nI was in the hospital for two days and then sent home. During my time at home, I did not get a card, flowers, potted plant, or phone call from anyone from the store or the home office. I was off work for two months. When I did return to work the asst. manager said it was ok to use an electric card to get around because I could barely walk. Around the time that this asst. manager transferred, the store manager then informed me that without a dr. note I could no longer use the electric card. I got a note from my doctor and was informed that it was not good enough but it had to be from the home office.\nI send the papers in myself because I was still getting bills that I had given to the store manager to send in to worker comp. Upon checking after about three weeks later, I found out the a manual chair had been approved along with a stool at my reg. I went in to the store to see why this had not been done because both the store manager and the personal manager had gotten not one email but two of them. \nI did settle the workers comp. case with a small amount of money. However when I applied for unemployment, It was turned down for the simple reason the under oath both an asst. manager and the store manager stated that I could have still worked for Walmart. At the time of the settlement with workers comp., I called the home office and asked if I could keep my discount card because of the CO2 and the things that happen after and was told no because I had not been with the company 15 years, however, I had been with the company for 11 years and 9 months.\nThe store was being remodeled, however, the permit for the remodel was never posted anywhere in the store. As there was gas powered saws being used inside of the store without open ventilation, and the contractor has never admitted fault for any of this. Also I would like to point out that there were never any monitors for CO2 put up before this happened.\n\nWalmart Hi Nancy - Thank you for sharing your experience with us. Please contact our insurance carrier Claims Management, Inc. at 1-800-527-0566 so we can assist you properly.\n.\n\nI called that phone number and after a week I was given another phone number however it was disconnected. So is it your feelings that we will just give a person disconnected phone numbers until they goaway.",

            "message": "Well, I already lodged a complaint with Walmart which was absolutely no use. I stated that the last time I was there, I was accosted while leaving the store because my receipt was buried in one of the bags and I was not allowed to leave until there was proof that I bought the items even though all were bagged and I just came from the register. Well, I went back again today. I had a pleasant conversation with one of the cashiers I have known for the past 20 years. I spent $205. As I was leaving, this time with receipt in hand, that wasn't enough. She wanted to go through my items and check them against the receipt. All items bagged except for the dog food. I was really livid and walked away from the girl. I told her that I just walked away from the register and if she felt I stole something she could call the police. I just walked out and put the items in my car. A manager came out of the store and watched me the whole time. If that wasn't humiliating, I don't know what is. I then went to Kroger and purchased $100 of groceries. I left the store without being harassed by anyone. I will now be shopping at Target, Kmart, Dollar tree and other grocery stores in town. I refuse to be treated with disrespect and made to feel like a criminal.",

The fact that your stores do not accept competitor coupons for things (example: 1.00 off two of xyz item) causes me and many others like me to stay away from your stores and go to other grocery stores that do accept competitor coupons. There are several in this Sunday's paper that I was hoping to honor in my local store since it is in fact 1 stop shopping, however, I will make the extra 20 minute drive to save myself some money at bi-lo since they do accept the competitor coupons. You people at the top who don't have to watch your pennies on a daily basis need to spend some time with the \"little guy\" and see how john q public lives. There are several others who feel the same way I do but don't take the time to make comments, they just stop shopping in your stores all together. Sales from competitors don't last forever so if you truly want to keep customers in your stores then you need to start matching deals and coupons better, so you loose a little on one or two items for a week or two, you have MANY other items in your stores to compensate for the loss.",

After months of research & price comparing I purchased from Walmart this ad because of the sale price and security & peace of mind of the name \"Walmart\" since it was for a very expensive investment. I only received one of the two items listed on my paid purchased receipt! After spending hours & multiple days working with the not so helpful Help Desk, waiting for 24-48 hours for manager to call back & never receiving one. All I get when calling back is \"it's unfortunate\" me & my family have to just deal with the inconveniences & additional expenses this false, miss leading advertisement sale has caused us. I have been offered a refund and that is all suppose to be okay! It does not matter, I purchase and paid for two items offered because I NEED them both! Now my money is tied up & Walmart does not care what financial nor physical damages they have caused my family! I am blown away at Walmart's help desk, corporate reps, customer service & blame game. I am in disbelief we have waited on our Walmart order shipment time, then time trying to get order issues resolved, now will have to wait on return shipping & refund time. Walmart could careless, they just post any detailed item description with model numbers & then say \"its unfortunate\" that's what it says you ordered but that's not what we meant to sell you!!! It was actually a third party contractor & that was not suppose to be the two items we advertised and sold you!... I've been told so many contradicting stores, reasons and excuses I'm just kicked to the curb! I plan to get copy of advertisement, my receipt, my tracking of TWO items & my consumer experience in front of as many customers as possible through all social media, BBB, consumer experts, etc. to help others & their families from the financial and physical inconveniences my family is having to endure!",

            "message": "I am so very disgusted with Walmart.  I ordered a 17' Skywalker trampoline for my sons birthday on July 28. I received an order verification email, with a comfirmation number, and a scheduled date of delivery; being August 4th. \nIssue #1: That date came and went....no trampoline. I tried being patient. On Monday the 8th, I called Walmart, only to be told I had never ordered a trampoline. After a 45 minute conversation, the lady finally informed me, Walmart had made a mistake. The trampoline I ordered was not available any longer. A courtesy email from Walmart explaining that would have been nice---anyway....I was told I'd have to order another one & she would rush it to me, free of charge. Which did happen. Thankfully. \nSO- my second issue is: I received an email stating I would be receiving a 17' x 15' oval skywalker trampoline on August 15. I never ordered, nor needed a second trampoline. I have no idea where it even came from, yet I was charged for it; using the same card I had purchased the original trampoline with. Once the second trampoline arrived, I refused shipment before it was ever taken off the UPS truck. Wayfair emailed me immediately, indicating their warehouse had been notified of the shipment refusal, and as soon as the packages were received, they would notify Walmart to issue a refund. I waited patiently...for seven days. No refund. \nIssue #3:  I called Wayfair to be sure they had received the package. They had, and had also notified Walmart. I called Walmart, only to be given the go-around. \"We see no order number for that trampoline\" \"You have to call Wayfair, there is nothing we can do.\" I called wayfair again, and was told they had done all they could do, since I paid Wal-Mart, they were (obviously) unable to issue a refund, I must call Walmart. So I did. After speaking with a customer service representative for another 45 minutes, I was finally told they could see where Wayfair received had received the trampoline and I would be refunded within 3 - 5 business days. So I waited.......no refund. This has happened for the past three weeks. Call Wal-Mart, told I'd be refunded in 3-5 business days, wait patiently, only to NOT be refunded. We're now going on week FOUR. I do not understand what the hold up is, quite honestly, at this point-- I don't care. Wal-Mart was quick to charge my account. ($426.99, TWICE!!! Which may not be a lot of money to some. But it is to me.) This is a mistake one of your employees made and it is WAY beyond time to refund me. I will not call Walmart again, if instructed to do so. I've wasted too much of my time calling and being lied to already.  I have done nothing wrong, other than order a gift for my sons birthday. I just got off the phone with your corporate office. This time I was told the refund would be issued in SEVEN days. I am still waiting...Not so patiently anymore. Absolutely ridiculous.",

In the past few years we have seen a decline in the number of folks working, specifically the checkouts. We spend a fair amount of money in this store for most of our household needs from groceries to engine oil and everything in between. It is quite frustrating to fill my cart full of groceries and all the essentials only to make my way to the checkouts and spend just as much time waiting to checkout as I spent shopping. My 3 year old son and I were shopping there yesterday, with a fully loaded cart I made my way to checkout. When I got to the front of the store I find that there are 4 of 24 lanes open with a human operating the register. Of these 4 lines, 2 of them were 20 items or less. And each line had a minimum of 6 people in it. I understand that the self checkout lanes are convenient, however, there are plenty of people that need more than a self checkout line. To me, to have only 4 lanes of 24 opened, it's ridiculous. Walmart is a MULTI-BILLION dollar company. How can walmart not afford to put human beings to work at their stores and run these checkout lanes. While shopping at our local Kroger store I never have these type of issues. I know numerous folks who have quit shopping at this walmart for this reason alone. We don't shop there in the heat of the Ohio summer because walmart likes to control the A/C from a remote location and it doesn't always keep the store cool. Keep your checkouts open, keep the air cool, keep the heat warm, keep your prices low, and keep your customers happy. Right now you're losing folks to Kroger, my family and I just to name a few.",
