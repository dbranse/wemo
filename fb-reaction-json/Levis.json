My name is Sonya and about a year ago I stepped on a nail and fell down a flight of stairs and in a blink of an eye went from a normal woman married and in love to the same man for 26 yrs. with 2 sons 25 and 23 who are the biggest Falcons fans ever! Sadly because of all my procedures, they had to put cement into nine verta. so that I could live a somewhat normal life. My husband and I were both back in college getting our degrees when I had to quit because just the pain alone was to much to bare. Now I am slowly able to get out of the house, well actually we lost our home a few days ago because my husband had to take so much time off of work to care for me that now we are just living on hope and love. We lost everything and now my oldest son Jonathan has also put is life on hold so we could stay with him in is tiny apart. in Tampa. However in less than a year my husband will graduate and has decided that he will go ahead and go for is MA. and I am going to go back to college within a few months and finish getting my BA. I am telling you this story because when I seen how the NFL loves Levis just as we do I just knew that even though we have no more than 2 outfits each and if I could do anything to thank my husband and sons, I would take them to a Falcons game and make sure they were decked with some great levis but until that day comes. I just wanted to put this out there in cyberspace letting the world know I am humbled and proud of just how much they have given up just for me. I can't wait for the day that I will be able to pay it forward. Much love and Bless you all!",

Over the last few years I have noticed a drop in the quality of these jeans. I have a dozen pairs that have torn in the crotch before I even see any wear on the knee. I haven't had a pair last a year. They use less material on the hem of the pant legs and they roll up and stayed rolled up whether you want them to or not. I always liked the quality of these jeans, obviously something that has been compromised to save money. However, @50 a pair these aren't cheap and the consumers costs keep going up. I do not understand. I expect them to last longer. Until such time as these issues are worked out I will no longer buy Levi's brand jeans. Sincerely.",

At least I thought I did till I went into the Levi store in Lincoln City. Tom and I entered the store and were greeted with a \"can I help you?\"  As Tom wandered off I said to the lady \"yes, I bought this pair of jeans and I like them but forget what they are called, do you have them?\" \nWithout asking me any questions she answered \"well I can tell you we probably don't have what you are looking for. The closest thing we have to a boyfriend cut is the 501. We don't carry anything for curvy girls here. I'm wearing the 501 right now and I don't have ANY curves\" she then proceeded to walk around me once, even pulled the top of my jeans out in the back to look for elastic in the waist. All of this in the middle of the store room floor in front of every customer. \nShe then said something about buying jeans with stretch and something about another store that honestly I don't remember because at this point I was like I deer in headlights. \nIt was then my darling husband turned around from the corner he was in and looked at my face. Walking towards me as the woman asked is there anything else she could help me with. \"No, I think I'll just go.\" I said and started for the door. Tom asked me what was wrong. I told him \"they don't have anything for curvy girls\" and we left. I spent the next 20 min in a complete daze! Something like this has never happened to me before. I'm still not quite sure what to make of it. That woman never asked me what size I am or anything. It almost ruined my shopping for the day. But I needed jeans really bad as I was down to one pair. So I finally went to old navy and got myself some curvy girl size 12s. Thank GOD there is at least one store who's manufacturers carry enough bolts and bolts of fabric to cover my enormous ASS!\nYeah I think I'm a little over being hurt and have moved straight on to mad!",

I went to our local store in Västerås, Sweden, and asked them to fix it. And so they did, except that I had them on for like an hour or two, a few days after the reparation, sitting in a car and they broke again. \n\nThis was on my way to my vacation too so I was really disappointed since I only had one more pair of jeans with me... \nWhen I got back I went to the store and asked them to fix them again. And so they did, but they said that these jeans has a very weak spot between the thighs, especially after the repair. They got sewed again and I took them home.\n\nI put them on this week, did my morning rutines and when I was on my way out the door for school, they broke again! This time I had them on for less than 30 minutes!\n\nI went back to the store with the same jeans for the 3rd time in less than 4 months. The girls at the store told me that this is a weak spot and I told them that this is the 3rd time they brake and I asked for a new pair of jeans. They said that all they could do is to try to repair them, AGAIN! They said that if you have a problem with pants to hold beacuase of your legs bump togheter when you walk, you shouldn't buy these jeans.\n\nThe funny things is that I haven't even got to wear theese jeans for more than a week in total! So that's not my problem this time!\nI am tired of being told that it's nothing they can do about it. \nI want a pair of jeans that holds for more than a week. / Disappointed customer in Sweden",

I have always had a pair, or pairs of Levi's in my closet each and every one of those years.  Why have you forsaken me by not having any denim jeans for women?  Not every woman on the planet wants stretch pants as jeans.  We want Levi's Jeans... you know... like jeans, not stretch pant jeans... jeans.  Recent years I have had to buy the men's button fly, which we all know, don't fit me because I am shaped like a woman, not a man.  Do you have any place near Severna Park MD that sells women's jeans?  I was at your store in Arundel Mills and bought my son his jeans for school and my 9 year old daughter and myself   had nothing made for us in your whole store... I am talking jeans, not stretch pants... Here's to hoping you sell women's jeans again.  Right now, I am sad.  Margie Mardiros",

Levi's does not accept credit/debit cards from many countries... that's fine! However, if you're cancelling orders for dumb reasons like the Billing country or IP address, then why attempt to authorize the transaction? Why cause people's funds to be placed on hold? Why inconvenience your customers in such a way. Let me just say...the mere fact that financial institutions authorize and 'hold' funds for a Levi's transaction, means the transaction more than likely will go through. I have proven that the billing countries Levi's rejects do in fact support VISA and MasterCard that's internationally recognised. Also LEVI'S, you're rejecting countries that strongly support your brand. STOP HIDING YOUR FINE PRINT. LET IT BE LOUD AND CLEAR. YOU CAN ONLY PURCHASE FROM LEVIS.COM WITH A USA IP ADDRESS AND SHIPPING TO A USA MAILING ADDRESS.\n\nBIG BAG OF DISCRIMINATION. Shameful !!! 😡😡",

I walked around that whole store looking for my size, walked it with my wife...looking for a size 44 x 32.... the guy in the store after walking around for 45mins tells me they dont carry that size...young lady working with chimes in saying she works at a couple of stores and shes never seen anything in the 40's and she thinks they cut for Europeans cause Americans sizes are bigger in frame and i would have better luck trying online... really sucks cause i been wearing levis all my life only to find out i can only shop online now. \nJeans are so personal and needs to be tried on first before purchasing cause each cut is different...each look, style and color is different. Im 46, i don't want to wear skinny, tight jeans i want to wear mens jeans...really hate i have to order online for jeans.",

I purchased a Dockers Premium Edition Alpha Khaki from the store and left it in your capable hands to alter it.\n\nWhen I returned to pick up my Khaki, I was surprised to see that the store had used a thread of a completely different colour, and the stitching was substandard.\n\nI expressed my displeasure to the girls at the store. One of the girls who attended to my concern was disinterested in listening to what I had to say. Instead, she mentioned that everyone in Malaysia knows that this is the kind of stitching people get when they get trousers altered. I would like to point out here that I have had a better experience getting my pants altered at a local shop. And I expected even better experience from an international brand.\n\nWhen I asked about the colour of the thread, she mentioned that the store received the trousers today, and they haven’t had the chance to get the thread of the correct colour, and this is the best they can do. I guess she did not think that it was necessary to inform me when I asked her to alter the Khakis. When I insisted, she came back with a couple of options with an expectation that I’ll instruct her which colour to use. I did not think it was my job to suggest the colour of the thread.\n\nI politely asked for an exchange since they were unable to rectify my problem. However, my request was declined by portraying that it was my error that I didn’t know either of the things. Supervisor was less than helpful too. I think they got away because I am not local (I am from New Zealand) and did not raise my voice at them.\n\nThe people at the store were unapologetic for what they did to me. I will urge to people to avoid shopping at Dockers 1 Utama.\n\nI hope that you, Dockers, would listen to me as a customer and not avoid me like people at the store. I expect that someone from your company will rectify my problem.\n\nThanks and Kind Regards,\nVivek",

I bought two pairs of pricey jeans because they fit perfectly in the store, but when I took them home and washed them they were suddenly two sizes too big. And this is right out of the dryer, mind you. I bought them on vacation and I can't return them to that store, nor do I have any Levi's stores near me. Levi's won't let me mail them in to be returned. They are not \"defective\" per se (in that an examination of them would not reveal the problem) so I highly doubt my claim would be recognized by the warranty inspectors. All I want is to exchange them for a smaller size and you're making it impossible. I REFUSE TO BE STUCK WITH $130 WORTH OF JEANS THAT DON'T FIT. I would never have bought them if they'd fit like this. Levi's even claims they're supposed to SHRINK after washing. This is utter crap. What the hell am I supposed to do?",

Have heard lots of amazing reviews before about Levi's jeans and their quality.\n\nHowever it is not even half year past purchase time and it is torn. Even with normal use . I don't do any activities with the jeans.\nIt is very sad, but I checked online and felt better as I saw that you are providing warranty for life. ( or at least for a year......)\n\nwith this idea I went to original shop where I bought it from. all i got was saying that is my mistake and nothing can be done.\n\nI feel that something must be done about it. I do not require necessarily refund, but at least fixing it or a replacement .\n\nBecause it feels like 90euros would go waste now , as i am still a student .\n\n*P. S i have all proof of purchase to send, if needed/\"",

I had the official receipt together with the untouched product still with tag and even plastic cover. Price 250.000 IDR = US$ 18,50.\n\nHowever your employee told me that it is not possible to return it, even though it says it on the receipt (within 14 days of purchase).\nWhen I told your employee about the receipt and tried to explain it to him, he started raising his voice and yelling at me, he introduced himself as Alester or Allister. \nThis has never happened to me before and after letting him know that his behavior is inappropriate and inacceptable I left your store in a very bad mood.\nI am sure, I do not need to tell you that an employee yelling at a customer in a store full of people is not the best advertisement for the brand and company.\nI felt not respected and mistreated as your customer. I appreciate Levi's clothing since 15 years especially for your high quality standards in terms of products, which are internationally.\nUnfortunately, your customer service standards do not seem to be internationally. The sales person in your store is the representative of your company and brand and the only direct contact to the customer, I am sure you do not want to leave such an impression, with me as your customer.\n\nI hope you can help me with this issue.\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA very disappointed Levi's customer :-(",

They were the only jeans that wouldn't do that gapping thing in the back plus they were high quality cotton with just a touch of elastic so they really lasted and wore in beautifully. It's been two years since my last denim purchase and I was sad to see they have been discontinued. I did however purchase two pair of the 711 skinnies and one pair of the 501 cts. The 501s are great! 100% cotton, super comfy yet durable and cool feeling. The 711s however are awful. I didn't realize they had such a high amount of polyester in them. They feel like I'm wearing stretch pants and have an immediate hot and itchy feeling that cotton denim does not have. I regret purchasing them and will return them. This is so disappointing because Levi's were like the last good quality affordable jeans for women out there. I know your men's jeans are still the same as always, so why do clothing companies continue to downgrade the quality of only women's apparel?!? Women want good quality comfortable lasting clothes as well. Maybe I am in the minority on that, but I just thought you should hear one long time customer's opinion. I hope you return to making high quality women's clothing across the board again in the future.",

I don't do any activities with the jeans.\nIt is very sad, but I checked online and felt better as I saw that you are providing warranty for life. ( or at least for a year......)\n\nwith this idea I went to original shop where I bought it from. all i got was saying that is my mistake and nothing can be done.\n\nI feel that something must be done about it. I do not require necessarily refund, but at least fixing it or a replacement .\n\nBecause it feels like 90euros would go waste now , as i am still a student .\n\n*P.

I already wore one pair twice, so I'm sure I can't return them. I bought them as part of a sale at the outlet in Silverthorne, CO where I had to buy two or more pairs to get the sale price. So, if I return one pair, I lose the sale deal. I guess I should have checked to see if my phone fits in the pocket. Even more important, you should know that our increasingly large mobile devices are essential in our lives. \n\nI would think that it would be part of product development to know what people carry in their pockets. I have no doubt that, if you surveyed a large group of Americans on what they carry in their pockets.... Let's say you did this Family Feud style.... The top three answers would include wallet, pen, mobile phone. \n\nSo, why wouldn't you test to see if the most common devices fit in your pockets.\n\nWow, I'm bummed.",

Here's my story. \nOrder 3 pares of 511, same model as I have always worn. Receive them only to find out Levi's has changed the fit completely to the 510. Understandable.\nI return and order 4 pairs of 510, waiting waiting, try to track them, nothing. I call to find out where they might be? Levi's \"Oh your order was canceled because of a credit card incompatiblity on the information, it should have sent you a notification about that?\" I have absolutely nothing in any area of my email. Not to mention when I did the reorder they said it was all set. FINE \nI RE RE order. Finally get the 510s only to find out that all 3 pairs all fit completely different, one is very close to my previous cut, but the other two could house an elephant in the crotch. \nOK fine,  I decide to drive into their outlet store in Seattle. I go to the Levi's online store locator find the Seattle store, and drive in. Park walk around trying to find it to no avail. I finally call, the person answers saying \"Hello Nordstrom\".  I go in figuring maybe its a store in a store, NOPE and they only have a few pairs of Levi's. Funny because it says it's the same as the other two Outlet Stores in WA. So now I have to drive way South to the other outlet store. \n\nMessage Here, DO NOT USE THE ONLINE STORE UNLESS YOU ARE PURCHASING THE EXACT SAME COLOR AND MODEL. \n\nI will say on the positive side the people I've dealt with over the phone have been some of the best I've ever had the pleasure to do so with.",

            "message": "Just popping in to say you guys have some of the worst customer service people handling your online orders. I had an order placed that qualified for a 35% coupon code. Upon receiving the order two of the items did not fit so I went to your store to exchange them for a different size. The customer associate in the store told me that they were online only so I left and called customer service.\n\nThe 1st person I talked to from Levis told me they were out of stock on the items. I had the website pulled up told the customer service agent that I could add them to my cart and Levis online showed them in stock. The customer service agent told me just reorder them and I would have to call back with my order number to have the price adjusted.\n\nThe 2nd person I talked to said since I used a 20% off coupon my 2nd order (to limited the pending charge amount on my card) that she would take an addition 15% after the initial 20%. I told her that \"x\" amount of dollars minus 15% then minus 20% separately did not total 35%. Anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics would understand that. I asked why she couldn't just match the prices of the items and she just repeated she would take an additional 15% off the initial 20%... I told her I would just cancel the order and reorder it with no coupon.\n\nThe 3rd person I talked to said they would issue a refund in the difference of what I initially paid vs what I paid for the reorder. I then waited a few days to see the refunded amount.\n\nI noticed I was shorted just over $28 on the refunded amount a few days later so I called back.\n\nThe 4th Levis representative I talked to said that how the 1st person handled the refund was incorrect and they have been with the department for a long time and knew of a better route. Anyways I explained that I was shorted on my refunded amount and that I would like the difference returned back on my credit card. After a long hold and many corrections on basic math (adding, subtracting and percentages) I was told that the refund would be expected in the next 3-5 business days.\n\nAfter waiting a week I called Levis back today and asked why my refund was talking so long. It appears that the last rep that was so \"experienced\" hadn't left any notes and further more, did not even put in for a refund. The Levis representative I spoke with was helpful but very rude. She cut me off mid-sentence multiple times. Said she was putting me on hold and didn't even let me finish talking. After the hold she asked for more information on the 1st order that I was matching and I gave her the order number. I asked her if I could give her the figures on what I paid the 1st time, what I paid the 2nd time, and the first refund so that she can calculate the difference to be refunded. She said she would do it her self and was putting me on another hold. After another hold the Levis representative said a refund of $7 would be applied. I told her that the refund was supposed to be $28. I then offered to give her the figures again which she listened to. After another hold she said my additional refund would be applied in 1-2 business days. I asked for a confirmation or reference number and she said her computer froze and wasn't able to provide one. So here I am again waiting.\n\nAnyways here I am typing this massive wall of text to let you know that you've lost a longtime customer. After this hassle with your company I don't feel like shopping Levis and going through your customer service ever again. Great product sold by a company who doesn't care about its customers enough to implement easy exchanges or ordering online through a brick and mortar store .",

Incredible read dealing with the truth behind alot of these hartford homocides we read/share about on fb everyday. Something has got to change! & I strongly believe this book has the answer. Spring has just begun & I'm already tired of going to funerals! This is a memoir of my mothers life filled w/ profound deaths & stories that go all the way back to the 60s in Charter Oak Terrace to the present streets of Hartford. Until we get the people in power to understand what really is going on, things will never change. We will just remain \"animals\" (as they call us) slaughtering each other in one of the richest, poverty filled states in the country. Book had me all emotional lol Go out & grab this phenomenal book! Available at Amazon, Kindle, Borders, & Barnes and Noble! R.I.P to all my friends whose story has made it to this book *Video Trailer Coming Soon*",

I recently purchased 2 pairs of 501 and a pair of 541 .not cheap at 65$ a pair . All 3 lasted a total of 3 months and were not even broken in and all 3 the crotch busted out .all 3 ? I love the 501 button fly , has been my favorite for years , but seriously guys maybe 10 wears and the crotch is already busted . I can't keep spending premium money for a product that just doesn't last ........",

I recently bought a new pair and had been wearing them for about two weeks (washing them a few times, of course), when one fateful moment, taking a seat on a low couch at work, and much to the delight of my co-workers--especially Erin--the air was pierced with a comically audible riiiiiip! The seat of the plants split along the left pocket a good eight inches. (Argument in favor of always leaving the house in clean underwear). I returned the pants to Costco, and picked up a new pair, same size and model. Six days later, getting into the car (and out of earshot of Erin and the gang), the new pants ripped. The same exact way. Pocket to cheek. This is all heartbreaking and frustrating, but mostly heartbreaking. I love my 514s (did I mention that?) What gives, Levi's? Thanks!",

            "message": "As a citizen of North Carolina, I am writing to express my displeasure at your opposition to North Carolina’s HB2 law, specifically your clearly insincere political posturing.  You, along with dozens of other companies signed a letter with the Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC expressing your opposition to the law.  Several of the companies on that letter also have either reversed plans to expand into North Carolina, or threatened to stop doing business here because of HB2.To all of you, I ask this: have you even read the law as it was written?  You say in the letter that “HB 2 is not a bill that reflects the values of our companies, of our country, or even the overwhelming majority of North Carolinians.”  Therefore, I would have to surmise that the values of your company include trampling the rights and safety of the many in order to curry favor with a vocal but in reality tiny minority. I say you are clearly posturing and trying to curry favor for several reasons. Allow me to exemplify one with this question if you genuinely believe in nondiscrimination for all people regardless of race, sex, religion or gender identity, then how long have you had gender neutral bathrooms in your place of business? You claim you are standing up for transgendered individuals.  The fact of the matter is, transgender individuals make up only .3 percent of the US population.  Therefore, the majority of your customers are from the 99.7% of Americans.  It is the money of the 99.7% that keeps your company in business.  I feel betrayed by your urgency to be politically correct, rather than remaining loyal to the families that support your business.  You are not standing up for the majority of your loyal customers. Again, in the letter, you say you pride yourself on being “inclusive and welcoming to all.”  Your opposition to HB2 and bullying the NC legislature with threats does not feel welcoming or inclusive at all. HB2 came to be in order to ensure protection for women and children from potential sexual predators. Charlotte’s city council ordinance would have allowed biological males to share the same restroom, locker and shower facilities as women and children. As a woman and mother, I find the accommodation that puts my safety and my teenage daughter’s safety at risk for the sake of political correctness appalling.I would also warn you to be careful that the tactics you use to bully the state in which I live may be turned against your company when you get on the wrong side of the runaway train of political correctness.Shame on you to those of companies who have threatened to or actually pulled business out of NC.  You say you are doing so because of your deeply held beliefs. You have the freedom to do that, thanks to the laws in place in NC.  That right is the exact one HB2 wants to ensure. I encourage you to rethink your stance on this issue, and understand that in this great country in which we live and do business, people can coexist and still hold differing opinions on various issues.",

Now,sadly although your product still brings a premium price,the Quality is nowhere near what they used to be. Levi's used to be the Industry Standard in rugged work wear,Now,sadly it appears all Levis is today is a marketing company.

I have constantly had problems with about 1 it off 4 pair ripping at the pockets or in the crotch and this is what was sent to you guys. These were not brand new but were still in great shape and less than a year old. I'm sorry that your customer support is no longer about taking care of customers. When I find a company loyal to me, I stick with them. But when that company no longer shows loyalty to me, I change companies. Don't worry, I'm not a big spender and would never be a blip on your radar but eventually there will be enough of us that you will notice the cost cutting effort will not pay off.

Yours is the only ad that I've seen that will lock up Hulu and prevent it from continuing to play my show for as long as it takes for me to click on that close button- I tried it out just to see, and your ad stayed on my screen for over an hour; when I closed it, the remaining two ads were over in less than 90 seconds (or six of your audio loops). For shame- you've lost me as a customer for a loooooong time; probably about as long as your commercial (get it? That means forever, since your commercial has no end!).",

Found a good price online with free shipping, so I ordered it. Problem is two-fold. First, the new jacket just doesn't fit right. Same size as my old one, but the cut is very different. Fits shoulders and waist and length is fine, but very tight across chest and sleeves are very tight. It's just unwearable and I doubt that the next size would fit either. And that's ok, but the other problem is that I have to pay $7.50 to return the package. This just doesn't seem fair. Luckily, I had free shipping, because if I had paid for shipping your policy is not to refund that either. So in the worst case I would pay $15 to try a jacket that doesn't fit. I'm unwilling to order another size because you won't do an exchange and with a new order I risk more shipping charges if it doesn't fit. This is not a fair policy for selling clothing online! I am completely disappointed with the Levi's online store and cannot recommend it.",
