My name is Sonya and about a year ago I stepped on a nail and fell down a flight of stairs and in a blink of an eye went from a normal woman married and in love to the same man for 26 yrs. with 2 sons 25 and 23 who are the biggest Falcons fans ever! Sadly because of all my procedures, they had to put cement into nine verta. so that I could live a somewhat normal life. My husband and I were both back in college getting our degrees when I had to quit because just the pain alone was to much to bare. Now I am slowly able to get out of the house, well actually we lost our home a few days ago because my husband had to take so much time off of work to care for me that now we are just living on hope and love. We lost everything and now my oldest son Jonathan has also put is life on hold so we could stay with him in is tiny apart. in Tampa. However in less than a year my husband will graduate and has decided that he will go ahead and go for is MA. and I am going to go back to college within a few months and finish getting my BA. I am telling you this story because when I seen how the NFL loves Levis just as we do I just knew that even though we have no more than 2 outfits each and if I could do anything to thank my husband and sons, I would take them to a Falcons game and make sure they were decked with some great levis but until that day comes. I just wanted to put this out there in cyberspace letting the world know I am humbled and proud of just how much they have given up just for me. I can't wait for the day that I will be able to pay it forward. Much love and Bless you all!",

Over the last few years I have noticed a drop in the quality of these jeans. I have a dozen pairs that have torn in the crotch before I even see any wear on the knee. I haven't had a pair last a year. They use less material on the hem of the pant legs and they roll up and stayed rolled up whether you want them to or not. I always liked the quality of these jeans, obviously something that has been compromised to save money. However, @50 a pair these aren't cheap and the consumers costs keep going up. I do not understand. I expect them to last longer. Until such time as these issues are worked out I will no longer buy Levi's brand jeans. Sincerely.",

At least I thought I did till I went into the Levi store in Lincoln City. Tom and I entered the store and were greeted with a \"can I help you?\"  As Tom wandered off I said to the lady \"yes, I bought this pair of jeans and I like them but forget what they are called, do you have them?\" \nWithout asking me any questions she answered \"well I can tell you we probably don't have what you are looking for. The closest thing we have to a boyfriend cut is the 501. We don't carry anything for curvy girls here. I'm wearing the 501 right now and I don't have ANY curves\" she then proceeded to walk around me once, even pulled the top of my jeans out in the back to look for elastic in the waist. All of this in the middle of the store room floor in front of every customer. \nShe then said something about buying jeans with stretch and something about another store that honestly I don't remember because at this point I was like I deer in headlights. \nIt was then my darling husband turned around from the corner he was in and looked at my face. Walking towards me as the woman asked is there anything else she could help me with. \"No, I think I'll just go.\" I said and started for the door. Tom asked me what was wrong. I told him \"they don't have anything for curvy girls\" and we left. I spent the next 20 min in a complete daze! Something like this has never happened to me before. I'm still not quite sure what to make of it. That woman never asked me what size I am or anything. It almost ruined my shopping for the day. But I needed jeans really bad as I was down to one pair. So I finally went to old navy and got myself some curvy girl size 12s. Thank GOD there is at least one store who's manufacturers carry enough bolts and bolts of fabric to cover my enormous ASS!\nYeah I think I'm a little over being hurt and have moved straight on to mad!",

I went to our local store in Västerås, Sweden, and asked them to fix it. And so they did, except that I had them on for like an hour or two, a few days after the reparation, sitting in a car and they broke again. \n\nThis was on my way to my vacation too so I was really disappointed since I only had one more pair of jeans with me... \nWhen I got back I went to the store and asked them to fix them again. And so they did, but they said that these jeans has a very weak spot between the thighs, especially after the repair. They got sewed again and I took them home.\n\nI put them on this week, did my morning rutines and when I was on my way out the door for school, they broke again! This time I had them on for less than 30 minutes!\n\nI went back to the store with the same jeans for the 3rd time in less than 4 months. The girls at the store told me that this is a weak spot and I told them that this is the 3rd time they brake and I asked for a new pair of jeans. They said that all they could do is to try to repair them, AGAIN! They said that if you have a problem with pants to hold beacuase of your legs bump togheter when you walk, you shouldn't buy these jeans.\n\nThe funny things is that I haven't even got to wear theese jeans for more than a week in total! So that's not my problem this time!\nI am tired of being told that it's nothing they can do about it. \nI want a pair of jeans that holds for more than a week. / Disappointed customer in Sweden",

I have always had a pair, or pairs of Levi's in my closet each and every one of those years.  Why have you forsaken me by not having any denim jeans for women?  Not every woman on the planet wants stretch pants as jeans.  We want Levi's Jeans... you know... like jeans, not stretch pant jeans... jeans.  Recent years I have had to buy the men's button fly, which we all know, don't fit me because I am shaped like a woman, not a man.  Do you have any place near Severna Park MD that sells women's jeans?  I was at your store in Arundel Mills and bought my son his jeans for school and my 9 year old daughter and myself   had nothing made for us in your whole store... I am talking jeans, not stretch pants... Here's to hoping you sell women's jeans again.  Right now, I am sad.  Margie Mardiros",

Levi's does not accept credit/debit cards from many countries... that's fine! However, if you're cancelling orders for dumb reasons like the Billing country or IP address, then why attempt to authorize the transaction? Why cause people's funds to be placed on hold? Why inconvenience your customers in such a way. Let me just say...the mere fact that financial institutions authorize and 'hold' funds for a Levi's transaction, means the transaction more than likely will go through. I have proven that the billing countries Levi's rejects do in fact support VISA and MasterCard that's internationally recognised. Also LEVI'S, you're rejecting countries that strongly support your brand. STOP HIDING YOUR FINE PRINT. LET IT BE LOUD AND CLEAR. YOU CAN ONLY PURCHASE FROM LEVIS.COM WITH A USA IP ADDRESS AND SHIPPING TO A USA MAILING ADDRESS.\n\nBIG BAG OF DISCRIMINATION. Shameful !!! 😡😡",

I walked around that whole store looking for my size, walked it with my wife...looking for a size 44 x 32.... the guy in the store after walking around for 45mins tells me they dont carry that size...young lady working with chimes in saying she works at a couple of stores and shes never seen anything in the 40's and she thinks they cut for Europeans cause Americans sizes are bigger in frame and i would have better luck trying online... really sucks cause i been wearing levis all my life only to find out i can only shop online now. \nJeans are so personal and needs to be tried on first before purchasing cause each cut is different...each look, style and color is different. Im 46, i don't want to wear skinny, tight jeans i want to wear mens jeans...really hate i have to order online for jeans.",

I purchased a Dockers Premium Edition Alpha Khaki from the store and left it in your capable hands to alter it.\n\nWhen I returned to pick up my Khaki, I was surprised to see that the store had used a thread of a completely different colour, and the stitching was substandard.\n\nI expressed my displeasure to the girls at the store. One of the girls who attended to my concern was disinterested in listening to what I had to say. Instead, she mentioned that everyone in Malaysia knows that this is the kind of stitching people get when they get trousers altered. I would like to point out here that I have had a better experience getting my pants altered at a local shop. And I expected even better experience from an international brand.\n\nWhen I asked about the colour of the thread, she mentioned that the store received the trousers today, and they haven’t had the chance to get the thread of the correct colour, and this is the best they can do. I guess she did not think that it was necessary to inform me when I asked her to alter the Khakis. When I insisted, she came back with a couple of options with an expectation that I’ll instruct her which colour to use. I did not think it was my job to suggest the colour of the thread.\n\nI politely asked for an exchange since they were unable to rectify my problem. However, my request was declined by portraying that it was my error that I didn’t know either of the things. Supervisor was less than helpful too. I think they got away because I am not local (I am from New Zealand) and did not raise my voice at them.\n\nThe people at the store were unapologetic for what they did to me. I will urge to people to avoid shopping at Dockers 1 Utama.\n\nI hope that you, Dockers, would listen to me as a customer and not avoid me like people at the store. I expect that someone from your company will rectify my problem.\n\nThanks and Kind Regards,\nVivek",

I bought two pairs of pricey jeans because they fit perfectly in the store, but when I took them home and washed them they were suddenly two sizes too big. And this is right out of the dryer, mind you. I bought them on vacation and I can't return them to that store, nor do I have any Levi's stores near me. Levi's won't let me mail them in to be returned. They are not \"defective\" per se (in that an examination of them would not reveal the problem) so I highly doubt my claim would be recognized by the warranty inspectors. All I want is to exchange them for a smaller size and you're making it impossible. I REFUSE TO BE STUCK WITH $130 WORTH OF JEANS THAT DON'T FIT. I would never have bought them if they'd fit like this. Levi's even claims they're supposed to SHRINK after washing. This is utter crap. What the hell am I supposed to do?",

Have heard lots of amazing reviews before about Levi's jeans and their quality.\n\nHowever it is not even half year past purchase time and it is torn. Even with normal use . I don't do any activities with the jeans.\nIt is very sad, but I checked online and felt better as I saw that you are providing warranty for life. ( or at least for a year......)\n\nwith this idea I went to original shop where I bought it from. all i got was saying that is my mistake and nothing can be done.\n\nI feel that something must be done about it. I do not require necessarily refund, but at least fixing it or a replacement .\n\nBecause it feels like 90euros would go waste now , as i am still a student .\n\n*P. S i have all proof of purchase to send, if needed/\"",

I had the official receipt together with the untouched product still with tag and even plastic cover. Price 250.000 IDR = US$ 18,50.\n\nHowever your employee told me that it is not possible to return it, even though it says it on the receipt (within 14 days of purchase).\nWhen I told your employee about the receipt and tried to explain it to him, he started raising his voice and yelling at me, he introduced himself as Alester or Allister. \nThis has never happened to me before and after letting him know that his behavior is inappropriate and inacceptable I left your store in a very bad mood.\nI am sure, I do not need to tell you that an employee yelling at a customer in a store full of people is not the best advertisement for the brand and company.\nI felt not respected and mistreated as your customer. I appreciate Levi's clothing since 15 years especially for your high quality standards in terms of products, which are internationally.\nUnfortunately, your customer service standards do not seem to be internationally. The sales person in your store is the representative of your company and brand and the only direct contact to the customer, I am sure you do not want to leave such an impression, with me as your customer.\n\nI hope you can help me with this issue.\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA very disappointed Levi's customer :-(",

They were the only jeans that wouldn't do that gapping thing in the back plus they were high quality cotton with just a touch of elastic so they really lasted and wore in beautifully. It's been two years since my last denim purchase and I was sad to see they have been discontinued. I did however purchase two pair of the 711 skinnies and one pair of the 501 cts. The 501s are great! 100% cotton, super comfy yet durable and cool feeling. The 711s however are awful. I didn't realize they had such a high amount of polyester in them. They feel like I'm wearing stretch pants and have an immediate hot and itchy feeling that cotton denim does not have. I regret purchasing them and will return them. This is so disappointing because Levi's were like the last good quality affordable jeans for women out there. I know your men's jeans are still the same as always, so why do clothing companies continue to downgrade the quality of only women's apparel?!? Women want good quality comfortable lasting clothes as well. Maybe I am in the minority on that, but I just thought you should hear one long time customer's opinion. I hope you return to making high quality women's clothing across the board again in the future.",

I don't do any activities with the jeans.\nIt is very sad, but I checked online and felt better as I saw that you are providing warranty for life. ( or at least for a year......)\n\nwith this idea I went to original shop where I bought it from. all i got was saying that is my mistake and nothing can be done.\n\nI feel that something must be done about it. I do not require necessarily refund, but at least fixing it or a replacement .\n\nBecause it feels like 90euros would go waste now , as i am still a student .\n\n*P.

I already wore one pair twice, so I'm sure I can't return them. I bought them as part of a sale at the outlet in Silverthorne, CO where I had to buy two or more pairs to get the sale price. So, if I return one pair, I lose the sale deal. I guess I should have checked to see if my phone fits in the pocket. Even more important, you should know that our increasingly large mobile devices are essential in our lives. \n\nI would think that it would be part of product development to know what people carry in their pockets. I have no doubt that, if you surveyed a large group of Americans on what they carry in their pockets.... Let's say you did this Family Feud style.... The top three answers would include wallet, pen, mobile phone. \n\nSo, why wouldn't you test to see if the most common devices fit in your pockets.\n\nWow, I'm bummed.",

Here's my story. \nOrder 3 pares of 511, same model as I have always worn. Receive them only to find out Levi's has changed the fit completely to the 510. Understandable.\nI return and order 4 pairs of 510, waiting waiting, try to track them, nothing. I call to find out where they might be? Levi's \"Oh your order was canceled because of a credit card incompatiblity on the information, it should have sent you a notification about that?\" I have absolutely nothing in any area of my email. Not to mention when I did the reorder they said it was all set. FINE \nI RE RE order. Finally get the 510s only to find out that all 3 pairs all fit completely different, one is very close to my previous cut, but the other two could house an elephant in the crotch. \nOK fine,  I decide to drive into their outlet store in Seattle. I go to the Levi's online store locator find the Seattle store, and drive in. Park walk around trying to find it to no avail. I finally call, the person answers saying \"Hello Nordstrom\".  I go in figuring maybe its a store in a store, NOPE and they only have a few pairs of Levi's. Funny because it says it's the same as the other two Outlet Stores in WA. So now I have to drive way South to the other outlet store. \n\nMessage Here, DO NOT USE THE ONLINE STORE UNLESS YOU ARE PURCHASING THE EXACT SAME COLOR AND MODEL. \n\nI will say on the positive side the people I've dealt with over the phone have been some of the best I've ever had the pleasure to do so with.",

            "message": "Just popping in to say you guys have some of the worst customer service people handling your online orders. I had an order placed that qualified for a 35% coupon code. Upon receiving the order two of the items did not fit so I went to your store to exchange them for a different size. The customer associate in the store told me that they were online only so I left and called customer service.\n\nThe 1st person I talked to from Levis told me they were out of stock on the items. I had the website pulled up told the customer service agent that I could add them to my cart and Levis online showed them in stock. The customer service agent told me just reorder them and I would have to call back with my order number to have the price adjusted.\n\nThe 2nd person I talked to said since I used a 20% off coupon my 2nd order (to limited the pending charge amount on my card) that she would take an addition 15% after the initial 20%. I told her that \"x\" amount of dollars minus 15% then minus 20% separately did not total 35%. Anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics would understand that. I asked why she couldn't just match the prices of the items and she just repeated she would take an additional 15% off the initial 20%... I told her I would just cancel the order and reorder it with no coupon.\n\nThe 3rd person I talked to said they would issue a refund in the difference of what I initially paid vs what I paid for the reorder. I then waited a few days to see the refunded amount.\n\nI noticed I was shorted just over $28 on the refunded amount a few days later so I called back.\n\nThe 4th Levis representative I talked to said that how the 1st person handled the refund was incorrect and they have been with the department for a long time and knew of a better route. Anyways I explained that I was shorted on my refunded amount and that I would like the difference returned back on my credit card. After a long hold and many corrections on basic math (adding, subtracting and percentages) I was told that the refund would be expected in the next 3-5 business days.\n\nAfter waiting a week I called Levis back today and asked why my refund was talking so long. It appears that the last rep that was so \"experienced\" hadn't left any notes and further more, did not even put in for a refund. The Levis representative I spoke with was helpful but very rude. She cut me off mid-sentence multiple times. Said she was putting me on hold and didn't even let me finish talking. After the hold she asked for more information on the 1st order that I was matching and I gave her the order number. I asked her if I could give her the figures on what I paid the 1st time, what I paid the 2nd time, and the first refund so that she can calculate the difference to be refunded. She said she would do it her self and was putting me on another hold. After another hold the Levis representative said a refund of $7 would be applied. I told her that the refund was supposed to be $28. I then offered to give her the figures again which she listened to. After another hold she said my additional refund would be applied in 1-2 business days. I asked for a confirmation or reference number and she said her computer froze and wasn't able to provide one. So here I am again waiting.\n\nAnyways here I am typing this massive wall of text to let you know that you've lost a longtime customer. After this hassle with your company I don't feel like shopping Levis and going through your customer service ever again. Great product sold by a company who doesn't care about its customers enough to implement easy exchanges or ordering online through a brick and mortar store .",

Incredible read dealing with the truth behind alot of these hartford homocides we read/share about on fb everyday. Something has got to change! & I strongly believe this book has the answer. Spring has just begun & I'm already tired of going to funerals! This is a memoir of my mothers life filled w/ profound deaths & stories that go all the way back to the 60s in Charter Oak Terrace to the present streets of Hartford. Until we get the people in power to understand what really is going on, things will never change. We will just remain \"animals\" (as they call us) slaughtering each other in one of the richest, poverty filled states in the country. Book had me all emotional lol Go out & grab this phenomenal book! Available at Amazon, Kindle, Borders, & Barnes and Noble! R.I.P to all my friends whose story has made it to this book *Video Trailer Coming Soon*",

I recently purchased 2 pairs of 501 and a pair of 541 .not cheap at 65$ a pair . All 3 lasted a total of 3 months and were not even broken in and all 3 the crotch busted out .all 3 ? I love the 501 button fly , has been my favorite for years , but seriously guys maybe 10 wears and the crotch is already busted . I can't keep spending premium money for a product that just doesn't last ........",

I recently bought a new pair and had been wearing them for about two weeks (washing them a few times, of course), when one fateful moment, taking a seat on a low couch at work, and much to the delight of my co-workers--especially Erin--the air was pierced with a comically audible riiiiiip! The seat of the plants split along the left pocket a good eight inches. (Argument in favor of always leaving the house in clean underwear). I returned the pants to Costco, and picked up a new pair, same size and model. Six days later, getting into the car (and out of earshot of Erin and the gang), the new pants ripped. The same exact way. Pocket to cheek. This is all heartbreaking and frustrating, but mostly heartbreaking. I love my 514s (did I mention that?) What gives, Levi's? Thanks!",

            "message": "As a citizen of North Carolina, I am writing to express my displeasure at your opposition to North Carolina’s HB2 law, specifically your clearly insincere political posturing.  You, along with dozens of other companies signed a letter with the Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC expressing your opposition to the law.  Several of the companies on that letter also have either reversed plans to expand into North Carolina, or threatened to stop doing business here because of HB2.To all of you, I ask this: have you even read the law as it was written?  You say in the letter that “HB 2 is not a bill that reflects the values of our companies, of our country, or even the overwhelming majority of North Carolinians.”  Therefore, I would have to surmise that the values of your company include trampling the rights and safety of the many in order to curry favor with a vocal but in reality tiny minority. I say you are clearly posturing and trying to curry favor for several reasons. Allow me to exemplify one with this question if you genuinely believe in nondiscrimination for all people regardless of race, sex, religion or gender identity, then how long have you had gender neutral bathrooms in your place of business? You claim you are standing up for transgendered individuals.  The fact of the matter is, transgender individuals make up only .3 percent of the US population.  Therefore, the majority of your customers are from the 99.7% of Americans.  It is the money of the 99.7% that keeps your company in business.  I feel betrayed by your urgency to be politically correct, rather than remaining loyal to the families that support your business.  You are not standing up for the majority of your loyal customers. Again, in the letter, you say you pride yourself on being “inclusive and welcoming to all.”  Your opposition to HB2 and bullying the NC legislature with threats does not feel welcoming or inclusive at all. HB2 came to be in order to ensure protection for women and children from potential sexual predators. Charlotte’s city council ordinance would have allowed biological males to share the same restroom, locker and shower facilities as women and children. As a woman and mother, I find the accommodation that puts my safety and my teenage daughter’s safety at risk for the sake of political correctness appalling.I would also warn you to be careful that the tactics you use to bully the state in which I live may be turned against your company when you get on the wrong side of the runaway train of political correctness.Shame on you to those of companies who have threatened to or actually pulled business out of NC.  You say you are doing so because of your deeply held beliefs. You have the freedom to do that, thanks to the laws in place in NC.  That right is the exact one HB2 wants to ensure. I encourage you to rethink your stance on this issue, and understand that in this great country in which we live and do business, people can coexist and still hold differing opinions on various issues.",

Now,sadly although your product still brings a premium price,the Quality is nowhere near what they used to be. Levi's used to be the Industry Standard in rugged work wear,Now,sadly it appears all Levis is today is a marketing company.

I have constantly had problems with about 1 it off 4 pair ripping at the pockets or in the crotch and this is what was sent to you guys. These were not brand new but were still in great shape and less than a year old. I'm sorry that your customer support is no longer about taking care of customers. When I find a company loyal to me, I stick with them. But when that company no longer shows loyalty to me, I change companies. Don't worry, I'm not a big spender and would never be a blip on your radar but eventually there will be enough of us that you will notice the cost cutting effort will not pay off.

Yours is the only ad that I've seen that will lock up Hulu and prevent it from continuing to play my show for as long as it takes for me to click on that close button- I tried it out just to see, and your ad stayed on my screen for over an hour; when I closed it, the remaining two ads were over in less than 90 seconds (or six of your audio loops). For shame- you've lost me as a customer for a loooooong time; probably about as long as your commercial (get it? That means forever, since your commercial has no end!).",

Found a good price online with free shipping, so I ordered it. Problem is two-fold. First, the new jacket just doesn't fit right. Same size as my old one, but the cut is very different. Fits shoulders and waist and length is fine, but very tight across chest and sleeves are very tight. It's just unwearable and I doubt that the next size would fit either. And that's ok, but the other problem is that I have to pay $7.50 to return the package. This just doesn't seem fair. Luckily, I had free shipping, because if I had paid for shipping your policy is not to refund that either. So in the worst case I would pay $15 to try a jacket that doesn't fit. I'm unwilling to order another size because you won't do an exchange and with a new order I risk more shipping charges if it doesn't fit. This is not a fair policy for selling clothing online! I am completely disappointed with the Levi's online store and cannot recommend it.",

I've never been more disappointed with how you work with your customers when they show up at your store or call into your call centre. I recently purchased a sweater and a leather jacket online in small and medium each to make sure I got a good fit. I had bunion surgery in mid-August, so I didn't pick up my packages from the store until about two weeks ago. I totally missed the return policy of 30 days from purchase. I assumed it started from the date of pick up. By the time I was able to walk and get the items, my return and exchange period had passed by 10 days for one and 2 days for the other (not crazy time frames) . DIspite showing up to the store today with everything in never worn condition, tags on, in box, receipt in hand standing in my cast, Zara Eaton Centre staff couldn't make any accommodations seeing as I wasn't some weird scammer. What they did offer was for me was to step to the side to call their customer service desk, but even they were less interested in helping me. The woman on the phone just recited the return policy. Neither the in-store staff of the phone agent offered to make the exception and let me choose some other items that I'd actually wear or give me a store credit much less a seat while a talked to the agent on the phone. Now I have $405 worth of things I'll never wear. I'll never shop there again on principle. Note to Zara head office, sometimes you need to just remember that people are people and life happens. Just because you write something on paper or online doesn't mean you can't make accommodations for those who spend their hard earned money in your stores and aren't trying to scam you. You earn loyalty that way. On a positive note, I did get flowers from the doctor who did my surgery yesterday and he does that for all his patients.",

However, in the past eight years or so, I've been noticing that the quality is not the same. Most of the knitwear, the basic cotton t-shirts and coats, don't last more than one season. I literally have to sew new zipers in all the new jeans and dresses I buy, because the original ones are so weak that they stop working after a couple of times. Lucky me, I know how to do it.  I bought a t-shirt two weeks ago and it's already pilling. I have already cut off the labels, so I cannot return it. It's basically trash now. It's really sad, because, as I said, I've been a client for so many years. I feel that, nowadays, it's all about the brand and not the quality.",

            "message": "Sehr geehrtes Zara-Team, \n\nheute bin ich in Ihrer Filiale in Lübeck, Breite Str., in Sachen Kundenservice schwer enttäuscht worden. \nIch habe am Fr., 16.09.,  dort drei Jeanshosen für je 25,95 € erstanden,  letztlich demnach 77,85 bezahlt. \nAm Folgetag habe ich die Waschetiketten in den Hosen entfernt,  wie ich das grundsätzlich bei meinen eigenen Hosen tue,  bevor ich sie das erste Mal wasche. Während ich die Hosen auf links drehte,  bemerkte ich,  dass eine unterhalb einer Gürtelschlaufe ein Loch hatte. Offenbar hatte jemand beim Anprobieren der Hose ein bisschen zu heftig daran gezogen. \nSie fragen sich vielleicht,  weshalb mir dies nicht beim Kauf aufgefallen ist. Diese Frage stellten mir heute auch die beiden Damen an der Kasse,  als ich den Versuch wagte,  die Hose gegen ein intaktes Exemplar umzutauschen. Ich erklärte,  dass ich die schwarze Jeans anprobiert hatte,  und aus Zeitgründen dann die beiden anderen Hosen (davon eine die beschädigte) nicht mehr anzog,  da es sich um die gleichen Modelle,  nur in anderen Farben,  handelte. Ich griff also bei den anderen beiden Hosen nur nach der richtigen Größe und ging so zur Kasse,  ohne die Hosen \"unter die Lupe\" zu nehmen. \nIhre Kolleginnen erklärten mir weiter,  man kontrolliere an der Kasse grundsätzlich die Ware,  die das Haus verlasse,  auf Fehler o.Ä. \nIch bin sicher,  dass dieses Procedere grundsätzlich Anwendung findet. Leider war in meinem Fall eine ziemlich lange Schlange an der Kasse und die kassierende Kollegin arbeitete sehr zügig und hat das Loch offenbar genauso wenig gesehen wie ich. Ich erklärte freundlich,  dass ich die Hose definitiv noch nicht angezogen und das Loch daher nicht selbst verursacht habe. Der Kassenbon belege ja nun auch,  dass die Hose erst kurze Zeit in meinem Besitz war - noch eher zum Untausch zu erscheinen,  war mir aus beruflichen Gründen leider nicht möglich.\nMir wurde von Ihren Mitarbeiterinnen weiterhin erklärt, selbst wenn die Etiketten noch in der Hose befindlich gewesen wären, handele es sich bei dem Loch nicht um einen gültigen Reklamationsgrund,  da man nicht nachvollziehen könne,  wer nun für das Loch verantwortlich sei. So etwas könne aber auch schnell passieren,  da die Hose an der Stelle ja auch \"sehr dünn\" sei. \n\nBei allem Respekt, wenn Sie bei Zara selbst so wenig von der Qualität Ihrer Ware überzeugt sind,  kann ich Ihnen versichern: Ich bin es nun noch weniger und kann sicherlich  nicht behaupten,  dass ich mich als Kundin bei Ihnen gut beraten oder behandelt fühle. Ich betonte auch mehrfach, dass ich kein Geld zurück verlange,  sondern lediglich um den Austausch der beschädigten Jeans gegen ein intaktes Exemplar bitte. Ihre Mitarbeiterinnen kamen mir leider in keiner Weise entgegen. \nDementsprechend bleibt mir nur das Fazit,  dass weitere Einkäufe meinerseits bei Ihnen nicht mehr erfolgen werden.\n\nMit freundlichen Grüßen",

            "message": "Unfair and totally inconsiderate treatment by Zara to customers:\n\nDear Zara \n\nOn the 4th of August, I bought a Trafaluc Denim wear among other items for my wife as birthday present in Zara oxford street branch in first week of august. This was supposed to be a “surprise”, so she did not accompany me to the shop, besides she was looking after a nine month old. On trying all the items, the Trafaluc Denim wear did not fit. I went back to the store in Oxford street for a refund. Now the issue is with the receipt. \n\nYou can understand my shock when I was told by the store staff that there is no refund or exchange without a receipt. In my complete disbelieve, and utter shock, I asked again, only for her to adopt a quite defensive demeanour ‘’I did not make the policy, you have to have your receipt, I am afraid, there are people waiting on the queue”. Without arguments, I went home in search of receipts. I could not find it. I went back the second time, bought more items for my wife, tried to return the previous item explaining that the receipt is not in my house and this is the second time. Not to bore with details but nothing came out of it. Last week Thursday (15th September), I went to buy shorts for my holiday in Spain, paid and tried to return the item the third time. You can now guess how irritated I have become at this point.\n\nI have contacted customer care:\n“Dear Edere, \n\nThank you for contacting Zara.\n\nIn regards to your recent enquiry, please be advised head office have reviewed your case and can confirm that the purchase receipt is required for any exchange or return.\n\nWe do apologise for the inconvenience“\n\n“’I did not make the policy, you have to have your receipt, I am afraid…..”, “…We do apologise for the inconvenience…”: what are you afraid for exactly and what are you apologetic about? Are you afraid because you want to force me to waste my hard earned money? Or are you apologetic because you can’t help but be insensitive to your customers? No matter how polite or rude you put it, or what ridiculous reason is behind this policy, it does not stop it from being one step too far this time. \n\nNow I ask, what is the real motivation behind this complete disregard to your loyal customers. I bought these items as part of an order that included other items. The order is associated with my debit card which I bought them with. I can see it on my bank statement. The Trafaluc Denim wear item is completely traceable through your back office or whatever system you use. Why would you make your customers suffer because of something trivial such as receipt loss when there are ways you can verify the validity of their purchase. These orders are stored in your databases, they are very much accessible to yourselves, there is no denying the truth that my receipt can be reproduced. Why is this option not available to us? Is this not spitting in the face of the very people that have solely made it possible for your business to be where it is today?, that your wages are paid?. How dare you treat us with such rudeness. May I remind you that this is tantamount to biting the very hands that have fed you. There are reasons why the likes of peacocks and bhs have disappeared from our high streets.\n\nThis one is a step too far. It is an affront to the very society that have kept you where you. \n\nOne question for you is: if you want me to keep this Trafaluc Denim wear, what do you want my wife to do with it? Add 4 more stones to be able to fit into it? Or perhaps, you suggest that I wear it instead? Or maybe keep it and waste the money? In these hard times? Or are you punishing me because you are worried I may have shoplifted the item? Every of your customer fits the stereotype? What about the fact that this item can be traced with my bank card, and my person validated in case I am fraud? Or are you simply being arrogantly spiteful towards the very customers that have patronised you? Or are you simply taking your loyal customers for granted by coming up with this totally selfish and despicable no receipt, no refund policy? May I remind you that you are in competition with the rest the retailers and all it takes is for this movement to go viral and it will not be long before the advantage you have enjoyed disappears, before you start to hit below your sales targets, before we all go elsewhere. Can you not implement cloud based receipt system and save yourselves the embarrassment of awful customer reviews?\n\nOkay now, I have worked very hard to save money to buy my wife presents and there is no way on this planet that I will allow you to waste my hard earned money. I want my money back.\n \nI am only just starting with this. One way or the other, I must find a way to feel not ripped off by Zara.",

I bought a jumper from zara Delhi a few days back. The size was not proper and fit not good so I decided to return it. Today at your phoenix store they tell me that because the tag is removed its not in a saleable condition? I have given them the bill, the tags and it is within 30 days of purchase- plus it didn't fit me so how did the manager Ms Madhuri and the associate Mr kamlesh come to a conclusion that because the tags are not there its not in a saleable condition ? This is absolutely absurd and not expected of a brand like Zara . If you have an exchange/refund policy please accept with returns with grace rather than embarrassing the customer. Really upset about this incident and I wish you apply and brief your staff on international standards for retail!",

There needs to be some leniency on the timing of your exchange policy. Every single store has a longer period for exchanges. This is so unfair that you treat your customers like this.

I phoned your customer service who reassured me that this was my only delivery and there was no other parcel to come.. Near on an hour later I've received an email to say that all of my items where packaged in the parcel 'correctly without any discrepancies'! The two items where most definitely not in the box, I would like them or a refund of the money I've paid for them! Your 'investigation' was an incredibly short one.. I'm sure mistakes have been made when packing parcels before! Mistake was not on my end though!",

I had a theft problem in ZARA two days ago. \nI was in the fitting room trying some clothes on. I had a ZARA bag with me theta had an overall that I got from ZARA Germany just recently and a sash from a new Michael Kors bag that I got. Before going into the fitting room, I've asked the employee where I should put the bag, and she told me to place it outside the fitting room as it isn't allowed to have any bags in. However, when I went out of the fitting room, I couldn't find my bag and just found a bag that contained ZARA heels in it. After a lot of negotiation, the employees told me to take the heels that were worth 90JDs and wait until tomorrow and maybe then the woman who took my bag would have it returned and if not, I can't return the heels and buy with that money. Nevertheless, I had in my bag a Michael Kors bag's sash which costed me 250JDs and an overalls which were worth 70JDs (which they don't even have in Jordan). Meaning that what I had in there was worth so much more than the 90JDs heels. \nNevertheless, I came in the next day as they said and had my second shock. The heels that they told I can refund and buy with the money worth it weren't even bought and were on hold! Meaning that I don't even have those 90JDs to buy with! I've then asked to see the cameras and they refused. \nI have no idea what kind of customer service is this. I've been a ZARA customer for over 7 years and this is how you treat your loyal customers? I am extremely frustrated as now I don't even have a EID outfit. I would also like to mention how unprofessional their customer care was! Other than their attitude, they weren't helpful at all and all they did was give me your Lebanese number and your email. \nI would just like to point out that ZARA is a well known, international shop and i would have never expected such a treatment. If they could t keep a bag at their own property, they shouldn't take it in the first place. \nNow I don't have an outfit to wear for Eid and the people that works in Zara were very mean and they didn't do anything they just gave a number in Lebanon and an email to contact with them. \nZara it's an international shop and if they can't keep the plastic bag at the first place, they shouldn't have not let me take it in with me.\nThank you,\nRama Abu Gosh",

Leider ist Massimo Dutti (trotz Kreditkartenbeleg und Originalettiket!!) nicht in er Lage mir die Jacke zurück zu nehmen und zeigt keinerlei Entgegenkommen. Das ist so schade, da bietet H&M sogar bessere Konditionen an und zeigt sich kundenorientiert. Wir sprechen hier von 170€ und es wäre wirklich schön, wenn sich Massimo Dutti wenigstens ein bisschen kooperativ zeigt.

I did not go to the store to get humiliated by your staff. He very adamantly told me that there is only one sales-person on the men's area and the store is not equipped to assist customers. I followed him all the way to the Zara women's store where he directed me to his senior manager Mr Bharat Bhushan, who said that he would look into the matter and won't be able to get the manager to apologize for his rude behavior. It is shocking how your employees treat customers. Thanks again for all the humiliation. I'm never going to a Zara store again and I hope that they keep the same attitude so that you guys keep losing customers. \n-Aditya Arora",

They dint even allow us to see the CCTV camera till we dint threaten them with police. Even the quality of the videos are so pathetic that it's of no use in identifying the faces.

I took it all home to try on and brought it back within 24 hours. When I got home to try on I realized the staff ( young and didn't really care ) forgot to put the receipt in my bag. I even called my coworker who was with me to see if she remembered anything and she thought the associate had given me a copy and kept a copy as she still had it in her hand when we left. I'm guessing that was the only receipt cause there's literally nothing in the bag. Anyway I called very next day to ask for help and the lady just told me I should know the policy if I'm a regular customer and HUNG up on me. Are you kidding ???? If I hung up on a customer , I wouldn't have a business in this day of age. Uh duh....I'm aware of the policy and I stated this has never happened. She didn't even want to listen to me or even attempt to help or even be nice for that matter. I'm now stuck with 150$ worth of clothes that don't fit. How disappointing. Talk about terrible service. Not even an attempt at a solution. I'd say she failed at her test on customer service today.",

Bon, je suis donc retournée dans la boutique Place des Halles à Strasbourg pour leur expliquer ma mésaventure. Quel ne fut pas mon étonnement lorsque l'on me refusa l'échange parce que j'avais coupé l'étiquette intérieure ! Et bien oui, aujourd'hui vous trouvez des étiquettes sans fin, vous les coupez parce que ça gêne plutôt qu'autre chose. Bref, non seulement on me vend un article défectueux mais on ne veut même pas prendre ses responsabilités en acceptant de le reprendre !!

Nadat hij een tijdje had gespeeld ging hij hangen aan de salontafel en huilen.  Wij dachten dat hij zich had bezeerd. Wij hebben hem toen lang moeten knuffelen want hij bleef huilen. Nadat wij hem in bed hadden gedaan moesten wij er in de nacht nog uit omdat hij huilde. Wij maar denken dat hij onrustig was omdat hij zijn speen niet had. Vanochtend werdt hij krijsend wakker. Wij hem weer sussen en een papfles gegeven. Toen ik hem neergezet wilde zetten om te gaan spelen tilde hij zijn voet op. Ik schrok en dacht hij heeft zijn voetje verstuikt eb knoopte gelijk de pyjama open om naar zijn voet te kijken en tot mijn grote schrik zat er een achterkant van een alarm in zijn voet. Daar heeft hij dus de hele avond en nacht dus mee gezeten. Zijn voet is rood en opgezet en heb het gedesinfecteerd en hij kan er niet meer op lopen. ik ben geschokt dat dit kan. Dit zat dus al die tijd nog in zijn pyjama en uiteindelijk is hij erop gaan staan. Ik vindt dit echt niet kunnen. Dit is ontzettend gevaarlijk. Ik bestel geregeld mijn kleding bij Zara en ben dus ook echt geschrokken en vreselijk  teleurgesteld in de Zara. Ik zal de foto's toevoegen en ik hoop op een spoedige reactie.\n\nL.f.Braafheid",

The reason is because I love 100% polyester tees with cool designs that are not made like a jersey and not looking like a jersey. My profile pic shows me wearing a 2014 Zara 100% poly tee. \n\nThe year 2014 had plenty of great designs but as the years have gone by, I noticed that your designers mostly design floral patterns and even then I tried to pull them off. I am a straight man in love with 100% poly tees with cool designs. \n\nMy problem:\n1) Please bring back more designs that are 100% polyester tees.\n2) Your Malaysian website has undergone plenty of changes recently and in the latest update, the fabric information is completely gone from the clothes. The fabric information is crucial for me if I want to know which are the 100% poly tees. Please bring that back. I am not asking for a search filter which is a new thing, just bring back the good old fabric information which you had before.\n\nThank you!",

            "message": "Dear Zara, \nIt seems that I am the next customer from a huge list of disappointed customers. A few months ago I bought a blouse which had a small tore by one shoulder after two days of wearing. After a discussion in the store, the storemanager offered me a new blouse. With suspicious care I tried on the new blouse at home, the tags were still on. After one day the seam was very weak, showed a run and I decided not to wear the blouse before it tore again. I went back to the store and the storemanager neglected my complaint, didn't want to compensate me at all. I got very upset by this. How is it possible that a blouse is tearing after one or two days wearing?! The blouse was more expensive than the average price of Zara clothes (40 euros), so I was at least expecting a little more quality for the price I paid. After calling with the headoffice, Zara told me to buy a new piece of clothing within six months, they were not able to pay me back even when the tags were still on the blouse and I was within the time limit for returning. For now my trust in Zara's quality and customer care has reached the bottom line. According to Dutch law I send a letter to terminate the contract because of default. An email with a confirmation of receiving the letter was send three weeks ago. Again my complaint is being neglected. Zara does not want to take any responsibility for the quality they deliver and asks prices that are not reasonable for this quality of clothes and customer care. Since I am not the first person complaining on this page (it seems like Zara is in default by its customers worldwide), I hope Zara will take steps towards its customer satisfaction and starts with compensating and taking responsibility. They are far behind with this comparing to other stores.",

However, the recent problem that I have experienced has really put me down. \n\nI placed an order to collect in store on 20th July. On your website, it's stated that order can be collected in store within 2 - 3 days, but the order didn't come until 2 weeks after I placed the order (1st August). \n\nDue to this delay, I don't want the order anymore and would like to have a refunds on this order automatically, without having to collect it. But Zara has made it way too complicated that it should be. Zara requested me to go to the store, collect it then process the refund, even though I said it's not convenience for me to go, as the store is far away. \n\nCompared to other shops like Topshop, I get refunds back automatically  if I don't collect the order within 15 days. \n\nPlease improve your customer service. I don't think I want to buy anything from Zara after this problem.",

So you lose about 7-10 returnable days just waiting for your package to arrive. If heaven forbid, like myself, your package fails to be delivered and you leave for vacation, you are out of luck. Zara will just tell you that you a) should have waited to pick it up or b) mailed your return back from your house (aka the one you are physically not at because you are away). Wouldn't even issue a gift card which would have to be spent at their store anyways. Did I mention this occurred a mere few DAYS after their strict ass month policy?

Perhaps we could put the fizz back in to our communications by using Facebook? As they say, a change is as good as a rest. Just to recap, in case you've forgotten, I purchased a pair of shoes from you on line. I loved those shoes, I adored them. It was shoe heaven. Unfortunately, when they arrived, they showed signs of having been worn and the leather was quite creased, although the label was intact.When I stopped crying over such a life changing disaster, I returned the shoes to you. It was lovely to hear from you when you rang me and it was the start of a very special relationship I thought. The phone call I made to you on 28th July at 16:32 where I discussed the shoes with your lovely call handler was resolved. You would issue a refund. Thank you. All sorted, or so I thought. You obviously liked the sound of my voice and chose to put in several further phone calls to me. When I got chance to ring you back, you told me there was no record of a refund being agreed. Anyway, I'll get to the point. After many email exchanges it appears you 'have no record' of my phone call to you on July 28th at 16.32. Very strange as you record all your calls. I did help you out by sending you a photo of my phone showing the details of the call. Our relationship was going through a turbulent stage, and you dumped me by sending back the shoes. I won't lie to you Zara, I was very upset by you ending our relationship so abruptly. Still, I don't want to be one of those bitter and twisted exes but would like to say this, under the nice new Consumer Rights Act (2015) our as I like to call it our 'Pre Nup' you have to offer a full refund if the goods purchased are faulty. Which they were. We both know that and I know its hard to move on after the ending of a relationship, Zara, but hey, the laws on my side and I really think you need to check your phone records again to find ouot phone call. An apology would also be nice and we can part amicably. Hoping my heartfelt letter to you lasts longer than 25 seconds on your glossy page and that you haven't moved on from me already. Because, after all, you need to learn from 'us' in order to treat future relationships you may have with respect.\nTake care Zara\nWith my best wishes \nHeidi",

We trek all over town to find the right size and when we finally do the sales associate refuses to exchange a size (not asking for a refund or different product). Siting it's been 3 months and they won't help. This is not ok. This is for a wedding. If they had of had the proper help in the beginning they would have had suits that fit properly. How can @Zara not even exchange a size when it's a suit that is continually carried and when all tags, hangers and garment bags have been left on?",

So I thought, great it will be slightly less than that in Pounds.\n\nThe girl at the till scanned it in an to my complete surprise it came up at £39.99!!! When I questioned she apologised and said we will mark it down the £35.95 which I accepted.\n\nWhen Manager Veronica came over, she abruptly said she would not reduce the price, and the reason it was more expensive was due to shipping costs..... In rough numbers you're saying it costs about £8 a bag to post, who is running you logistics operations!?!?!?\n\nVeronica said the till girl was wrong to offer a price reduction (bit humiliating for the girl), and did I want the bag or not as she would/could not agree to reduce the price as marked.\n\nAs the manager was quite stand offish and with a queue forming behind me I decided to buy the bag and make a quick exit (which was not so quick as a tag was left on the bag meaning I had to make my back into the store to have deactivated).\n\nCertainly not a good experience, and will make me think twice of whether to bother buying in Zara in future!",

This is not good customer service and she should have done more to help. I had my baby with me and felt embarrassed at the cash desk and now have a pair of shoes that are not suitable.

But this time I had faced a lot of inconvenience and mental harassment. When I purchased this trousers (attached pic), I had asked for alteration,they refused stating that due to peek sale session it can't be done right now, please bring it after 03rd of July. Second time when I went on 05th July, the tailor master was not available that time so I had to come back without getting it altered. Third time when I went on 10th  August, again the tailor master was not available and the lady asked me to drop it and collect it next day. Also she informed me that an alternation will cost you Rs 60 which was quite surprising for me as I had never paid before to\nZara or any other store for alteration. I asked to call their manager, after 20 mins of waiting time, a person by the name of Mr. Abhishek came with Beetlenut (PanMasala) in his mouth very casually and straight away gave me an I'd \"Cutcare@in.inditex.com\" to write my issue. \" I WAS TOUCHED WITH HIS SERVICE EXCELLENCE AND I MUST APPRECIATE ZARA TO HAVE THIS KIND OF MANAGERS ON THEIR PAYROLL WHO SPEEK WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH PANMASALA IN HIS\nMOUTH\". KUDOS \nPlease give me a one good reason that why I should not escalate the above issue in Consumer court or\non social media wherein : \n\n1. Neither it was mentioned on the\nbill nor in the store that customer will have to pay the\nalteration charges?? \n\n2. Where it is written on the bill or\nin store that in Sale time alteration will not be done?? \n\n3.Why should a customer bear the cost of transportation and\nparking charges everytime because of your lack of\nresources??\n\nHope to get a response with compensation details\nbefore Monday else I'll be forced to file a case against\nInditex in Consumer Court.",

We went into a store but the lady in the store helped us buy the product online. One of the pants did not fit, so we had to purchase another pair. When I went to return the pants after the wedding I was informed I had missed the return deadline, however due to the fact that none of the receipts I received had any indication of the return policy a lady at customer service helped me return the product. Finally after a month I received a call telling me I missed the deadline to return and they were sending it back to me again. How frustrating and not even my fault!!!!",

Và một ngày chỉ đủ sức đăng được 1 lần như thế. Nếu bạn dùng #udlamgiau , bạn chỉ mất 1 phút để đăng 720 Groups một ngày hoặc đăng vài nghìn Groups nếu bạn cho chạy đồng thời nhiều tài khoản.\n.\n👉 Nếu bạn đăng thủ công thì lúc ăn, ngủ, đi ra ngoài, … nó trở thành “thời gian chết” trong quỹ thời gian kinh doanh của bạn. Nhưng nếu có @udlamgiau thì vấn đề đó sẽ được giải quyết triệt để.\n.\n👉 Sự khác biệt là rất lớn, nhưng chỉ mất chưa tới 1.000Đ/ngày để nâng khả năng tiếp cận khách hàng của bạn lên một tầm cao mới. Bù lại, nhờ tiếp cận được với nhiều người, những người có nhu cầu về sản phẩm của bạn cũng tìm được tới bạn nên số lượng đơn hàng sẽ tăng lên. Chỉ 1 – 3 đơn hàng gia tăng đã giúp bạn đủ trả chi phí cả năm rồi, thời gian còn lại là lúc nó mang lại lợi nhuận cho bạn. Mà hơn thế, nhờ @udlamgiau lượng khách hàng tiềm năng vẫn liên tục gia tăng.\n.\n👉 Thay vì cắm mặt vào máy tính hay smartphone để đăng bài và chấm chấm ở comment mới có khách hỏi hàng, thì ăn cũng có khách hỏi, ngủ cũng có khách hỏi, chơi cũng có khách hỏi mua hàng…\n.\n👉 Đầu tư một tài khoản @udlamgiau chỉ với 360k/năm để có thể chạy đăng bài ngay cả khi tắt máy và có thể sử dụng trên tất cả các thiết bị với việc mua một phần mềm vài triệu mà khi nào bật máy phần mềm mới hoạt động thì bạn sẽ chọn cái nào???\n.\n👉 Chi phí 360k/năm hoạt động, tính ra chưa tới 1.000Đ/ngày, trong khi nhờ ứng dụng, bạn chỉ cần bán được thêm một đơn hàng là bù đắp được gấp cả trăm lần phí dùng ứng dụng của ngày hôm đó, chưa nói tới việc nhờ ứng dụng mà có thể tăng 10 – 30 đơn hàng 1 ngày. Một sự đầu tư quá lợi!!!\n.\n☀ CÓ PHÍ KHÔNG NHỈ?",

Była tylko jedna sztuka i miała dokładnie takie samo rozdarcie ( niedokładne przeszycie na szwie). Przyszłam z tą sukienką do przymierzalni - Panie odesłały mnie do kasy, abym porozmawiała z Managerem i otrzymam upust za wadę. Poszłam do kasy. Pani przy kasie mnie wręcz wyśmiała. Rzuciła sukienkę do pudła i oświadczyła że towar wybrakowany odsyłają do zakładu...Nie ma szansy na żaden upust. Sukienka kosztowała 199 zł i miała wadę taką, że trudno było by samemu to ładne zszyć - upust ok 30 - 40 zł spowodowałyby że sukienkę bym kupiła i była zachwycona empatią ekspedientek, a sklep polecałabym koleżanką. A tak - macie niezadowoloną klientkę. A na koniec najlepsze - sukienka była po południu wystawiona znów jako pełnowartościowy towar w sklepie! Ktoś  się  nabierze. Tyle razy robiłam u Państwa niemałe zakupy dla siebie i dzieci - nie rozumiem takiego podejścia do klienta, a już wywieszenie tego towaru....dla mnie nie uwierzenia.",

            "message": "Hello,\n\nI want to report my unpleasant experience I had with Zara stores in Frankfurt.\nIt actually happened last month.\nI thought it wasn't worth to write about at first.\nBut I was writing about racism experiences I have faced as an Asian woman living in Europe, and thought this particular one might need your attention.\n\nSo here it goes.\n\nIt was in the store in Frankfurt Konstablerwache. When I made the purchase, the cashier didn't give me the receipt directly onto my hand. I thought she might have put it in the bag with the clothes because they do that sometimes.\nThe queue was very long, and I didn't want to waste other customers' time, so I stepped aside the queue and went through the bag to make sure that I wasn't mistaken about not getting the receipt.\nThe receipt wasn't there, so I went back to the cashier and told her that she hadn't given me the receipt. \nApparently she was very annoyed and asked me to double-check my pulse. I did so in front of her. It wasn't there of course because she never gave it to me.\nShe told me angrily that next time, if I don't get the receipt, I'd have to tell them immediately. I told her that I thought she might have put it in the bag, but she cut me talking and said \"No, No.No.\"\nShe gave me a new receipt with no prices on, but said it shouldn't be a problem to return or exchange.\n\nAbout a week later, I went to another Zara store in Frankfurt Hauptwache. I picked up some new clothes and wanted to return some clothes I bought before. When the cashier here saw my receipt, she seemed a bit confused and upset because there was no prices on. She spoke to her colleague, and this colleague explained her some stuff. Now they both looked quite annoyed, then asked me if I had the master card I had used to pay for the 1st purchase with me. I said I did and showed it to them. But they went \"Are you sure? This is the card?\" I said yes, and then they asked again \"100% sure?\"\nI said yes again. I felt like I'm some sort of credit card thief? I tried to explain them what happened at my earlier purchase and the receipt but they weren't listening but just speaking to each other in German.\nFinally all the process seemed to be almost done. Now they needed my signature on some kind of return receipt. At this moment, an old Chinese lady came to the cash desk and put her stuff on it. I guess she thought I was done there. Okay. It was rude of her to not wait for her turn and just expected to have her stuff checked out like that. But what's even more rude was that the cashier pushed the lady's arms off the cash desk without saying anything but only with the very annoyed face. Like she's not even a person. I mean, the cashier could've just said something like \"Please wait on the queue.\" Is it too crazy to do that?\n\nMaybe it's just me overthinking, but I feel like if I were white, this wouldn't have happened. I mean, cutting while I talk, never saying sorry, blaming me, and making me feel like a thief.\n \nIf it wasn't anything to do with racism, then you probably want to consider training your staff to be less rude in general.\n\nI'm sorry for such long post and thank you for taking your time and reading.\n\nThanks.",

Ich schneide also alle Preisschilder und Inlayschilder ab, damit ich das ganze Sammelsurium erstmal waschen kann. Da fällt mir bei einem Zweierpack Langarm-Strampler ein Diebstahlschutz auf. Ein Diebstahlschutz??? Bei Onlinebestellungen? Ernsthaft? Leider bin ich aufgrund meiner mangelnden \"Dieb-Erfahrung\" nicht im Standesamt dieses Ding selbst (ohne Schäden an den Stramplern zu machen) zu entfernen... zumal, wie gesagt, mir die Notwendigkeit bei vorausgezahlten Nachhauselieferungen sowieso äußerst fragwürdig erscheint...  \n\nMit den beiden BEZAHLTEN Teilen kann ich nichts anfangen und ich ärgere mich schwarz, dass ich mir bei 30 Grad mit 4-monatigen Baby den Weg in die Stadt ersparen wollte, weil ich ihn jetzt wahrscheinlich eh gehen muss, um dieses Ding entfernen zu lassen!\n\nÜber eine Reaktion Ihrerseits freue ich mich!",

I ordered some clothes on Thursday and I paid £9.95 so I could have my clothes delivered In time for my first holiday I've had in 5 years on Monday, it didn't get delivered and when I phoned your customer service line I was told my order wouldn't get to me until Monday! If I knew it would have come on Monday I would have done the free delivery! And your staff told me there was nothing they could do about it, not even a refund for the delivery charge! Not impressed, and now I have no clothes for my holiday :(",

Apparently the store return policy is different to the website return policy, but this is not made clear on the website.\n\nThey offered me an exchange, so I went about the store looking for items to exchange with, when I took these to the counter I was then told that once I make this exchange that even if my new items don't fit me I can't take them back and exchange for the correct sizes?\n\nThis policy seems absolutely bizarre to me! When they first told me I could get an exchange they didn't inform me that it also had very strict conditions.\n\nI'm a loyal customer of Zara's and shop there every month, so was very surprised and distressed by the treatment I received today.",

My family  has been wearing zara since its inception.  my 1 yr old grand son  also has been wearing zara since his birth. So for me to write this has been very difficult.I bought a pair of shorts from the baby boy section and it said in the wash care that it will fade. Since I am from the garment trade  since 40 yrs I understand that the garment is overdyed . But this particular garment in question has excessive bleeding. There is a difference between bleeding and fading. When I explained this to your store manager mr swapnil pawar at the high street phoenix, mumbai store he just ridiculed my knowledge. My daughter also works as a design head for kids wear in a reputed indian corporate and can understand the technicalities of the product. This is no way to behave with a loyal customer and specially when he knows the subject well. You need to train your store managers to deal with customers appropriately. An exchange was all that he needed to do. Instead of that he was very adamant and arrogant. You need to justify this kind of behaviour as its highly unacceptable. I got so agitated with the whole scene that I left the garment at the store and walked off. I dont know if this show down was highlighted to you guyz but as a concerned consumer I had to do it. Pls let me know how you are going to tackle this issue. Zara needs to keep up to their reputation and hire more knowledgeable and responsible staff. The least that swapnil pawar  could do was to be kind enough an offer an exchange and speak well to a customer who is his fathers age. I m expecting a positive feedback on the above situation asap.",

            "message": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing in to lodge an official complaint on today's Yeezy 350 V2 launch happening at your adidas Originals store located within Pavilion Mall, KL. I trust the upper management of adidas Malaysia will look into this complaint officially and seriously, and I demand a speedy response from your good office. Please kindly take note that without an acceptable response from your good office, I would raise the case to the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) and Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (FOMCA).\n\nJust to provide an overview of what happened since as early as 5AM in the morning. A line started right in front of the main entrance of Pavilion Mall by the Hibiscus Fountain, with your loyal customers lining up as early as before 5AM in the morning. I reached and joined the queue at approximately 7.45AM, with about 250-300 people lining up in front of me. The first few in the queue was told by the security guards that it was the \"official queue\" for your Yeezy 350 V2 ballot tickets.\n\nAt approximately 9.30AM, hundreds of people rushed in to the front of your retail store from all different routes and entrances. Those at the first 100-200 in the line were dumb founded, only to realise their effort to start queuing were futile. Hence, there was no more queue, only chaos.\n\nTo be fair to the management, it could not be considered 'wrong' for not providing the consumers a proper queue system. However, this is surely a case of mismanagement, since adidas Malaysia had done launching and balloting for various Yeezy's and NMD's since nearly 2 years ago. We as consumers have sufficient reasons to believe that, by now, adidas Malaysia should have known how to better manage the frantic crowd.\n\nNow let me raise the most unacceptable clear cut case of consumer mistreatment.\n\nThe ballot ticket registrationwas delayed for only 5 minutes, and started at 10.05AM. However, upon approaching your store manager and retail staffs of adidas Originals @ Pavilion 3 times, I could not be given a simple answer for a simple question - \"What is the total number of ballot tickets available for the Yeezy 350 V2 launching this Saturday?\"\n\nYour store manager first told me that the ballot ticket registration is supposed to be managed by a 'Third Party' which happened to be late for the registration. Upon further questioning, only to realise that the 'Third Party' she claimed is actually a team from adidas Malaysia HQ. She promised to call me back upon speaking to her 'HQ' to inform the number of ballot tickets available.\n\nYour store manager kept her promise and called me back after approximately 20 minutes, from the retail store's landline - 03-2141 8198. Unfortunately, she gave me no answer, only to quote her 'HQ' for saying \"the number of ballot tickets available cannot be revealed\".\n\nHence, kindly enlighten me a question that your store manager failed to answer on behalf of her company. Why is the number of ballot tickets available for the Yeezy 350 V2 raffle not allowed to be announced to the consumers queuing for the tickets? We were not asking for the number to be disclosed a day before, an hour before or 10 minutes before. The registration for ballot tickets had already started, and yet the long queue of consumers were made to queue and wait for their ticket which they have no idea if they could obtain.\n\nHow many skipped school? How many called in their office for MC or Emergency Leave? Have some empathy on the consumers who paid for your operational costs and your salaries please.\n\nI am very unsatisfied with your lack of management on simple activity / event coordination, the consumers deserve to be treated with dignity, so does your retail team members. Please do not put so much unnecessary stress and anxiety on your retail crew and the poor consumers.\n\nAn email of the same content had been sent to all members of management a moment ago. Your kind response is highly appreciated.\n\nRegards,\n\nSebastian",

Jedoch für sein Alter noch sehr verspielt und noch nicht entsprechend entwickelt, was das Spielverhalten betrifft. \n\nLeon lud vor Wochen einige seiner bisher engeren Freunde zu seinem Geburtstag ein, der entweder eine Schatzsuche hätte werden sollen oder ein Tag in einem Indoor Spielplatz. \n\nleider haben alle anderen Kinder abgesagt. \n Einige mit der Anfrage, ob man nicht mal zum Bowlen oder zum Laserteck gehen könnte...dafür interessiert Leon sich aber noch nicht.\n\nLetzten Endes feiert Leon seinen Geburtstag dieses Jahr ausschließlich im Kreise seiner Familie, was er natürlich sehr zu schätzen weiß, jedoch fehlt ihm der altersgerechte Anschluß...\n\ner ist dieses Jahr unheimlich traurig, weil er der Ansicht ist, daß mit ihm etwas nicht stimmt, weil sich die Kinder von ihm Abwenden und scheinbar nichts mehr mit ihm anfangen können.\n\ner gibt sich selbst die Schuld, zweifelt viel an sich und ist zur Zeit in einer schwierigen Phase des Selbstzweifels, was mich als Mutter unheimlich traurig macht und mir lange überlegt habe, wie wir Leon an seinem Geburtstag eine besondere Freude machen könnten.\n\nEs sollte nichts mit materiellem zu tun haben, sondern etwas für das Herz sein, etwas besonderes. \n\nDa Leon ein..für einen Jungen seines Alterns außergewöhnliches Hobby entwickelt hat, kam mir dazu die passende Idee..\n\nLeon sammelt und liebt schöne Postkarten. \n\nDarum habe ich mir als seine Mutter, die eigentlich eher sehr introvertiert ist...die Idee und den Aufruf rausgenommen, hiermit im sozialen Netzwerk an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen und viele Menschen zu erreichen...mit der Bitte...falls sie eine Postkarte übrig hätten...Leon vielleicht einen Geburtstagsgruß mit ein paar lieben Worten zu senden...\n\nSomit bekommt er Post von vielen Menschen, die er nicht kennt/ die ihn nicht kennen..denen er es aber trotz alledem Wert ist, sích die kleine Mühe zu machen, meinem Sohn ein Lächeln ins Gesicht zu zaubern und ihn davon zu überzeugen, daß er es für all die Menschen Wert ist...weil er wirklich ein einzigartiger, besonderer Junge ist, der es verdient hat, daß es Menschen gibt, die seinen Geburtstag mit einer kleinen Geste der Nächsteliebe bereichern....\n\nPost ginge somit an : Stichwort \" : Geburtstagsaktion für Leon Röhl\"\n Unser Lädchen / 53560 Vettelschoß...\n\n( Eine Straße oder Hausnummer ist noch notwendig, da Unser Lädchen die Postannahmestelle ist)\n\nIm Vorhinein bedanke ich mich ganz herzlich für die Anteilnahme bei jedem Einzelnen, der sich bereit erklärt, meinem Sohn diese Freude zu erweisen. Herzlichsten Dank! Stefanie Prange",

I've become completely fed up with wearing them because of the continued squeak they make with every step I take. This was never an issue with the first three pairs I bought (maybe a slight squeak the first couple days but certainly not persisting beyond that). I was even going to the extreme of applying a daily coat of talcum powder between the tongue and the rest of the shoe to try to silence them but it has gotten to the point where I no longer have the patience to continue this ridiculous routine. Have I a bought a defective pair or are all new SAMBA models prone to this annoyance? I asked the store where I bought them what I could do and they said there was nothing they could do. I wouldn't recommend Adidas shoes after this frustrating experience.",

My favourie childhood sneakers :D 3 months ago I bought new pair of superstars and after these 3 months they're looking worse than my 6-yo pair... They broke inside and outside!! I took them to shoemaker and he told me that many many people gave this model to fix!! Before I gave it to shoemaker I took it to your brand store to make complaint but unfortunately they don't accept returns or exchange. Your shoes were really good quality, but now they're shitty like made-in-china cheap sneakers from bazaar. In my opinion it's deceive and now you have one client less. (Sorry for my English, it's bad like your fu**ing superstars).",

Es waren zudem auch noch meine Hochzeitsschuhe !!!!! Man sagte mir Adidas hätte kein \"A\" mehr und deshalb könnte man nicht JANINA0909 auf den Schuh drucken (komisch: das erste A wurde gedruckt: JANIN0909) Somit kamen die Schuhe zwar früh genug, aber falsch personalisiert - jedoch zu spät um die Schuhe nochmals zu bestellen !!! Ich könnte kotzen und habe mir jetzt ein paar Nike Air Max BW dafür gekauft, denn Nike hatte noch ein \"A\" 😂 (wenns nicht so traurig wäre, müsste ich grad lachen) ! ich habe \"euren\" Fehler bei der Bestellbestätigung bemerkt und ca. 1 Stunde danach gleich bei der Adidas Hotline angerufen, die Dame mit komplett russischem Akzent meinte das sei jetzt Pech und ich soll halt warten bis die Schuhe kommen aber die brauchen sowieso 5-10 Tage 😂😂😂😂Und NEIN liebe Frau - ich mag den Schuh mit dem falschen Namen meiner Frau dann nicht für 15% weniger behalten ! Ich gebe ihn zurück und bedanke mich für meinen versauten Hochzeitstag ! Wenn ihr gewollt hättet, hätte man direkt reagieren können - aber dazu fehlts leider an der deutschen Sprache eures service Teams und an Kompetenz! DANKE FÜR NICHTS !",

I don't care what his artistic vision was, and I do not want to hear about how little you knew about the events that were going to unfold  prior to the show, etc. He is representing your company and therefore you are at fault as well. You have a obligation to those that support you to speak up, otherwise it is fair to assume you support this ridiculousness. I can not support a company that condones behavior such as Kanyes. It is disgraceful and you should be apologetic and embarrassed to be associated.",

There were only two large jackets displayed so I asked an associate for some help. The associate was happy to assist and the only one in the store who seemed so. Unfortunately, they were out of my size. I went to the fitting room to try on a few other items and when leaving the fitting room I went to hand my items to the associate (working the fitting room) my unwanted items (which I hung myself as I also work in retail) and the associate put his hands up and said, \"You can put it back yourself\". I was a bit in shock because generally associates working fitting room areas would take your items. He proceeded to tell other clients to hang and run items to the floor themselves. A few minutes later I then ask if it would be possible to place an order in store to be shipped to my home. I was told no but I could, \"do it myself online\". No alternative options were given to check another store or anything. I was really disappointed in the customer service as I would expect something more from such a responsible and well known company. Working in retail is by no means an easy job, I will be the first to admit. However, the front runners of a company are the retail workers and it seemed as though business and customers were not first priority. I found the Broadway location with my size in the items I wanted with great help at the register. But asking customers to put things back themselves, and not assisting in doing everything they can to make a sale just seems a little odd to me.",

Pidió nota de crédito pero se negaron en hacer la devolución ya que por políticas de \"Adidas\" no les harían nota de crédito, que eso estaba informado en el ticket adjunto a la boleta, un poco irrisorio ya que el ticket sale posterior a la compra y eso no fue informado antes de comprar, entonces les mostraron un cartel con sus políticas que está detrás del mesón de atención y que además en ese momento estaban tapadas con unas cajas de otras zapatillas, mi sra. Un poco molesta por la situación levanto un poco la voz y la encargada de tienda en ese momento no tuvo mejor idea que llamar a los guardias de mall plaza, ósea que más puedo decir muy mala Atención de parte de los encargados que indicaron de manera déspota que además ella no había sido la que compro y que no tenían porque hablar con ella, que por nada no harían la nota de crédito y que se dirigieran al sernac (muy ético de su parte), más encima mi sra. Pregunto cuando llegarían modelos nuevos y le indicaron que fuera a la tienda a revisar ella, que no tenían fecha de llegada de productos, que podía ser entre un mes, dos meses... \nyo hoy fui nuevamente a hablar con el jefe de tienda el Sr. Guillermo Andres Arias el cual me atendió de manera amable, pero volvió a reiterar que por políticas de \"Adidas\" solo podemos realizar nota de crédito solo de podrá realizar cambio de producto...  \n\nA todo esto tuvimos que incurrir en comprarle otras zapatillas a mi hija en otra tienda y de otra marca después de este incidente ya que tenía un cumpleaños y necesitaba unas zapatillas nuevas, Si necesitan les envió fotos de la boleta y producto para que vean el estado en el que se encuentra.\n\nAtte.\nJonathan Carrasco.",

I went to the branch and I met someone called Tamer Amin \"Maybe he is the branch manager not sure\"; he was respectable but he didn't want to listen to me at all and all he wants to prove that the perfume is normal. I even told him to test himself to check it but he refused. I didn't want my money back, but I wanted another usable one as the one I have is really like water.\nI'm an Adidas customer and this is first time to face this problem.\nI have the receipt mentioning that return/exchange could be in 14 days, but he refused to give me another one as well.\nKindly advice about this problem as this wasn't Adidas standard.\nI'm very disappointed from the quality of the perfume I got!!\n\nWaiting for a contact,\n\nRamy Makram\nAlexandria - Egypt",

I have been expecting to receive the shoes this weekend. How can Adidas just sent me an email telling my shoes won't be shipped anymore?! Since this is a limited edition, how can you ask me to find another pairs? \n\nMy sister ordered another pairs of NMD_R1 even after I placed my order; however, there is no problem with her order. \n\nI need a clear justification. \n\nSophia 8/26/2016",
