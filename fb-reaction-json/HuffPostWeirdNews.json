            "message": "Hi my name is sophia. I was born on april 21 in 2014 with something they call spina bifida myelomeningocele. \nWhen I was still in mommy's tummy they found out I had spina bifida. It was scary. But mommy and daddy were up for the challenge. I was a big baby cause mommy had some boo-boos during pregnancy. I had my back closed by the doctors 3 hours after I was born. I had a feeding tube because I didn't really eat much and i couldnt grow very well. I didn't care for food. But I learned to take a bottle eventually. Ive been cathed every 3 or sometimes 2 hours since birth  because I had trouble peeing... that's a complication from spina bifida. After a while I got to go to the pediatric floor out of the nicu so mommy could stay with me and learn how to take care of me all by herself. The main thing that kept me in the hospital was me not eating. But it was a good thing I was there for so long because the day mommy and daddy were going to bring me home my head got a little bigger. I think I had a headache. They did some test and came to the conclusion I had Hydrocephulus. Another complication from spina bifida. They were going to put in a shunt the next day and thought i was doing fine and it could wait. Mommy and daddy went home with my big sister olivia and we're going g to come back in the morning because olivia doesn't like hospitals. She's a baby. Well when mommy got up in the morning she called the hospital like she did every morning she couldn't stay in the hospital with me. It turns out they did my shunt surgery in the middle of the night because my heart was beating a little slow. I'm sad mommy wasn't there. I wish the would've called her. She was so sad she couldn't be there for me. But she was there when I work up because it took a little extra longer for me to wake up then other people. I woke up in the he pediatric icu. I liked the people there here there was always someone in the room when mommy couldn't be in there. But i was happy to get out a few days later back to the pediatric floor because my head incision was healing up but at the same time the doctors made a boo boo and no one told the nurses I was supposed to be on my back. So my back boo boo wasn't really healing up good it actually got worse and was just a hole in my back. They had to teach mommy to put this pretty silver stuff in it to get in safe and from getting yucky. Eventually I was peeing more on my own and they tought mommy to cath me to help me pee. That was good. So finally I was gaining weight and I got to go home with my mommy and daddy and my big sissy. I loved it. I had on more surgery when my shunt failed and i had to have an emergency surgery to fix it. that was my entire 2014 year... But 2015 brought utis... bad utis that i had to stay in the hospital for and get IVS. So we added new stuff and made changes and are still working on preventing all my utis.  ",
