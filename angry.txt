i understand the sentiment but i think it's misdirected.. police, fbi that ignored a kid with a serious, dangerous problem. if this happened and who knew i'd say otherwise. but everyone knew. complacency led to being compliant.

but #sweets @ erinonyourradio he always been like that. unless he is #angry. #lmao

! australia has ample capacity to take in migrants and #refugees #australia #bringthemhere … 
interesting and inspiring to hear phillip ridley answer questions on his process and what makes him at the @ swkplay tonight. 
great work from @ maxlindsay & co - sharp, bold and heart-wrenchingly fierce. loved it! 
that’s all for now guys! follow @ wearetramp for more about and @ terripaddock for more about her q&as! (or me for more sparkling personality and wit.) 
so, what makes the team #angry? @ geohenleyreal: people who talk in the cinema!!! @ tyronehuntley: intentional ignorance. and when people blow smoke in your face. @ maxlindsay: trains. bullshit. ^ (there was a lot more to this one, but that was the gist.) 
i want to write liquid fire in a poem right now. 
if you’re feeling the #fomo - @ terripaddock will be hosting 2 more q&as with the team @ wearetramp @ swkplay on wednesday february 28 & monday march 5! (i’m doing my best to keep up, but this is much better live.) 
staying is like taking #poison and waiting for the other person to die. – anon 
it wasn’t all intensity, though! @ geohenleyreal tells us that they started adding an extra 20 minutes on to their lunch break so the team could keep up with @ rupaulsdragrace. 
directing a minimalist production like is “no less difficult” than larger productions, says @ maxlindsay, because working for 8 hour days one-on-one with the performers is “incredibly intense... incredibly draining... emotionally, physically, mentally exhausting.” 
philip ridley’s writing advice to those students: “you don’t discover it by trying to discover it. you only discover something in a dark room by falling over it. you have to fall over the truth... so never be told what you can & cannot write. you define what you’re doing.” 
if anyone’s interested - some secondary school students in attendance at tonight’s performance will have their very first plays staged @ swkplay april 16-18 (as their writing for performance teacher just told us)! support the next generation of philip ridleys! 
“the audience really does inform the performance. the energy really changes depending on how they respond.” - @ tyronehuntley “every night, there are certain moments that look out into the audience and i always see people just nodding.” - @ geohenleyreal 
. @ geohenleyreal’s parents are in tonight — i was sitting across from her mother & i think she was the only person in the audience crying harder than me at the end. @ wearetramp 
@ skyvegas haven’t got #thatwinningfeeling because all my mates got payouts and i’m left with nothing #yourserversarepony #whydoibother better going to @ bet365 
philip ridley likens the piece to a musical album - “in an album, each song means something on its own, but the whole album together means something different.” 
“my first audition was so bad. i was so nervous i accidentally ran into an improv class and i remember leaving the audition and calling my parents and crying.” - @ geohenleyreal couldn’t have been too bad, georgie! 
just made this sign and about to sit in my drive way and watch every dog owners reaction when they walk by

review ***** by philip ridley @ swkplay - "a two-hander starring @ tyronehuntley & @ geohenleyreal, it consists of six monologues. it won't be to all tastes & it certainly asks more questions than it provides answers... but the performances are superb"

what is frustrating is how most people went to work! if you don’t bother to collect rubbish for a week you collect the missed collection the following week - both. what you don’t do is leave us with a month of recycling that won’t be collected for the 3rd week running!!! 
just watched carragher footage wow @ carra23 you lost it mate 
so fucking sick of having my past thrown in my fucking face. apparently i don't deserve any respect so screw you. #depressed 
i don't mind couriers occasionally damaging things. accidents happen, and drivers are under immense pressure to meet impossible targets. i do mind when you pay hefty fees for insurance and the company refuses to pay up, leaving you with broken stuff and a huge bill.

turns out that "walk in clinic” @ 10hbhealth isn't actually a clinic anymore - it's an assessment - if they decide you aren't in danger, you have to come back again for an appointment - next appointment in 1 week - apparently they are very busy #inpain 
woke up - decided i couldn’t ignore my symptoms anymore - checked @ 10hbhealth online for appointments - first one at 2pm. phoned booking line - waited 10 mins - asked if any morning appointments available - response was "nah" - awesome beside manner / customer care

@ bbc disgusting programme with catherine tate about the british bulldog breed. you've damned the breed and described all bulldogs as unhealthy. so far from the truth. you've cut lots from your show, showing healthy bulldogs and charities. so you can keep slating the breed.

so did mine. however now there is not a safety net & mine went up again plus i got larger & more copays. trump’s not doing us any favors. as his tax cut for the top 1% continues you’ll see, all the tariffs he’s placed on our once allies & rebutal tariffs = crashed economy!

russia has the emails of the @ gop when they got the dem emails. more than likely they are all complicit to prevent their emails from being made public or turned over use against them. mcconnell is a crook. he’s from my neck of the woods but don’t know how he got elected. 
you don’t even know who you are talking to, dan knows his stuff. i totally agree on the corruption. no one has ever been as corrupt as trump in the wh. he blatantly admits he works with russia. eric t said they have all the money they ever need through russia. #appalled
