@ huaweiphones you should take apple's example: send replacement batteries for nexus 6p. battery is dead at 50% no warning. started when phone was less than a year old. or at the very least respond to emails sent to customer service. #worstcustomerservice 
evil said it's nbc that's shutting down chiller. she became disappointed because it was her favorite horror movie station. #horror 
usually like my meals @ swisschaletca but #won'tbegettingthatagain beef dinner

honestly a little disappointed i didn’t wake up in a ditch... i now know 2018 will be a more responsible year. #newyearsday2018 #newyear #2018ishere 
“win it all and you never have to say sorry again...” what kind of message is that sending @ espn? #poor #thinkbeforeyouspeak #rosebowl2018 
new year, same lsu team 
@ mgaent we bought 2 big lol surprise balls, my daughter was so excited.... until they had identical dolls, bath fizzes, etc. you guys should make them all different, we would definitely have bought more. :(

hey @ twitter @ verified.... why is @ bluelivesmtr a verified account? this is crazy!!! does isis have a verified account? how about those khaki wearing nazi’s? 
thanks for defending me, nick! not trying hard enough to mend bridges between yourself, @ willpike10 and myself... … 
oh right... great... so there is someone active on the account... just not capable of responding to any of my many posts... again... top class service... 
the new black mirrors season did not live up to the hype. #blackmirror4

you know you have nothing worth stealing when you leave your keys in the car parked on the street for more than 24 hours and no one steals your car or uses the keys to enter your home. was kind of hoping to get murdered in my sleep last night. 
there's nothing i hate more than lies and it's even worst when it comes from someone you really trusted and looked up to #smh 
thanks @ united for leaving our luggage in houston. hard to enjoy the beach with no swimsuit. #unitedairlines

my thoughts exactly!! i was so excited at 9pm and expected to see so many diverse ladies!!! i'm hoping there's more to enter at a later date..otherwise viewing figures will be very low @ bbuk @ channel5_tv #representationmatters #morediversity … 
omg @ amazon the "certified refurbished" element tvs you are peddling are garbage. grandson's only has black screen after two days usage. 
@ timhortons how you've #changed since i #first worked there years ago.. gone were the days of in house made food... fresh coffee... and workers rights.... i have two kids who want to work at tim's when they are 16. please don't make me have to crush their dreams 
i guess they are seeing it now. #sad 
so bummed that @ hallmarkchannel took off #lastmanstanding and put all this full house on!

people can be such a disappointment... #femaletodisappointed #ftm #transguy 
:'( 
@ cadburyuk soooo disappointed with the new roses wrappers! can’t find my faves anymore #lost #bringbackthebarrel 
so much for small town customer service. @ veraalert on hold forever to talk with someone in another state(tennessee to be exact) to make a payment that used to be taken by a nice voice down the street. #painful 
can someone tell me why it is so hard to tell the truth??? #confused #ugh 
this is so unacceptable taken off of standby only to be placed back on it? huh? plus dealing with super unfriendly staff. #nightmaretravel will never again fly @ southwestair ... @ delta where u at? 
@ chickfila has officially become @ mcdonalds by charging for sauces #smh 
@ meliahtlresorts its a shame i can't get a refund for a room booked for june due to peter kay having to cancel his tour for personal reasons. customer service team have never come back to me

checked our tv schedule here and it doesn't look like it is showing in ontario. bummer! what a great show, love rodie and aubrey. we were looking forward to the new series. 
@ clarins_uk hi, got £15 voucher, applied it to £55 item, postage went from free to £3.95. hardly fair. 
so much for a repeat by the us in #wjc2018 
@ timhortons shame on the franchisees of tim horton's that refuse to pay their workers fairly. #timhortons 
@ thebookpeople feel completely let down after item failed to arrive again and again despite taking payment and promises to resolve. now finally am told that it’s out of stock and i’ll be refunded- that’s okay then! #poorcustomerservice 
@ srishivananda i just signed on to @ paypal as a new customer. about to launch my national organization. just to find out that donors who use @ googlechrome can't make a donation. i'm furious! i thought you had the best platform. #closingmyaccount @ dan_schulman 
notice how jake hasn't supported logan on any platform atall yet.but when jake fucks up logan's always the one who's got his back.it was definitely wrong btw just saying shows you the type of guy jake really is if you couldn't tell already. @ keemstar @ jakepaul 
that @ ravens graph though lol it seemed impossible that they wouldn't make the #nflplayoffs and yet... … 
for sure!! it's like sessions is a little kid at doj and "deep state" in charge says to sessions-go over there and keep yourself busy w/ pot & ms-13 gang so we can keep obstructing congress & continue the corruption at doj/fbi. sessions certainly is not in charge! 
@ macys @ simplehuman this is how you ship a “new” garbage can?!?! it’s missing the protective styrofoam and all scratched up. 
@ netflix_ca can u explain why you'd remove a middle season of a series rather than just removing the entire season? example: @ thekilling season 3 is gone but seasons 1, 2 & 4 remain. what's the logic? #bettertobuythanstream 
elevation is disappointed #tehborg 
ah has @ _victoria_queen not yet met dr who? #behindthetimes #toothandclaw does this mean his human doesn't get the job of wedding photographer? 
nah, words are 100% definitely more important, speak louder and need to be heard @ disney @ waltdisneyco @ youngwomenscot #feminism

my #echodot died & malfunctioned! @ argos_online couldn't replace as " out of shock " neither can you @ amazonuk " till later this month " not fair when your @ hivehomeuk depends on it @ amazon & all ones systems are on #fire 
dear @ amazonecho how is it that you never mention that the only way to set up alexa calling is through a smart phone? seems like it discriminates against folks who don’t have one. 
fell off for a moment. but i have drawn a line underneath and moved forward. #keepgoing 
not you also. what temperature increases (global warming) means, is that as temperatures rise you will see more extremes in weather patterns. scientists had to change the term to climate change because our country is full of idiots.

i just hate soup, hence the purpose of my tweet. ate it though, wasn't as bad as i remembered it being as a kid. didn't magically cure my cold though. 
there is no cheese i love more than gouda. how does it not work on my scrambled eggs? #stickwithcheddar 
few things as unappetizing as walking into a new restaurant & seeing fox news on the big screen at the bar.

futurecast says the snow will stay juuuussst south of us.

@ nysc @ clubsheretohelp still no response. you guys told me to email you guys and a week had gone by and ive reached out multiple times. guess this kind of customer service isnt only at the gym i go to. #badcustomerservice 
when you ask someone for help they shouldn’t refuse and also say no i can’t make a suggestion or recommendation or anything or openly refuse to help when it’s their actual field of expertise #bad #notcool #rude 
@ hawaiianair frustrations w/customer svc who won't accommodate my disabled 12yr old in extra room seat without paying extra exorbitant fee. @ alaskaair and @ jetblue. why not you, @ hawaiianair? 
far from happy reading statements attributed to you, saying that a 2nd ref could be only run in 2021! the final deal must come to the uk public for them to decide in 2019, i don't see any difference to your party & the conservative party! thought higher of you! 
you’re starting to be like the rest of them 
really @ bostonpizza ??? if paying almost $50 for two large pizzas wasn't bad enough then they have this much grease? 
@ delta happened 2nd time in 6 months, for my special veg meal request on intl flight, ist got boiled veggies as a meal and snack never made it so got bananas. really, @ delta is this what constitutes veg food? #customerservicefail

@ kyliecosmetics so excited to get my hands on the burgandy palette only to find out i can't use. #disappointed. thanks to the combo of using carmine and red 40, i've had 1 of the worst allergic reactions for the last 3 days. many brands make reds w/out carmine or red 40 
so i’ve walked across campus multiple times today and i never literally froze to death

@ thetnkids @ jtimberlake @ tmfansupport #motwtour it all started 5/12/2000 w/nsync. then 3 more times. i've seen every mem solo show. even small venues at the beginning. all i wanted was to come full circle & bring your newest, biggest fan, my 8 yr old. 
i'm a little with bixby on @ samsunguk s8 it's so slow to open applications. i made the same request with @ googleuk assistant and google had the app open and ready in a 1/5 of the time. samsung it's time to give up on your assistant

i placed my order on the 26/12 which i still haven’t received! upon investigation (by myself) i found the package in georgia, damaged!! they’ve stated i can’t have another until they receive it!! if i’ve learnt anything, you’ll be waiting a long time @ ryot_official

fuck you @ hulu. you took the first 2 seasons of superstore off and i wasn’t done watching!!! #deletingaccount 
woah way to milk it @ nintendoamerica 3 sets of joy-cons you know how expensive that is??? might as well buy an htc vive for 150 more and get a way more in depth vr experience … 
the #hijab is a sign of the oppression of women so it is absolutely mind boggling that the @ huffpost would publish an article like this and that @ loreal would run this campaign. #metoo @ huffpostwomen @ … 
ha...funny, @ sprint still cant get it together! i have wasted so much time w/ sprint customer svc! #servicesucks #bad #poorservice 
ghost is completely white wash... what happened to his shayaris in last 57 episodes which used to screams betrayal revenge... in edt

@ tescoirl not very impressed with the tesco app i downloaded, first order i made i get called next day to say no stock and therefore i'm not getting what i ordered... #fail

what?!! like that’s it?!? there’s going to be part 2 or what! #theopenhouse @ netflix 
@ dolesunshine way to cheap out on your southwest salad, and then blatantly lie and mislead the public. you removed your sour cream a long time ago, stop pretending it didn’t happen... 
when you find out that one of the closest people in your circle turns out to be a one of the biggest piece of shit. 
i wish my #fobmania cd & vinyl came in the mail today since it’s release day, but nope. 
i campaigned hard on housing demands affecting our community. i was derided and called greedy. yet everything i said on the campaign is repeated here for the umpteenth time. it has grown in such degree that csu has to partner to find housing for its employees. … 
@ voluspacandles bought #voluspa baltic amber jar candles for years one i got for holidays hardly lasted. poor response from customer service 
@ pampers must be trying out some new closure technology - no straps required? 
jail? maybe there you will get some motivation under the shower. get the hell out of dortmund. 
when you finally get the chance to watch a video for diamonds, then the app freezes on you 
. @ stopandshop why don't you stock @ knorr garlic & herb sauce mix packets at store #701 in newport, ri? this is the third time i've had to settle for the alfredo mix for my tortellini and chicken with asparagus dish instead. 
sooooo, my lady and i just wasted an hour and 34minutes of our lives watching “open house” on netflix. @ netflix, what are y’all are doing.....? 
we're not looking for safety. we want liberty. #getawarrant 
were these improvements implemented before or after i received my results two days ago... indicating i am 97% western european, 2% middle eastern and 1% nigerian? what a waste of money. #refundplease 
i ordered this shit and was suppose to get the brush, and paste with it. didn’t get either. andddddd it took weeks to deliver. i ordered it around black friday. i got it yesterday. #bohosucks 
so disappointed. 18 months with my tag carrera, it falls apart and not covered by warranty. 48 hours and no reply from customer service @ tagheuer #poorqualityservice 
@ lovisajewellery worst shopping experience. my 12yo daughter bought earrings yesterday. got home and realised they aren't the right type of sleepers. never taken out of box. told not allowed to return them. not great for a little girl who loves your store 
sure wish atlanta #powertothepollsga had been been done right. photos and videos from rest of country is what we should have had here. 
i'm so disappointed in @ loving_tan customer service. i have always been a loyal customer, purchased multiple bottles! i had an issue with my last bottle, they had me jump through hoops to prove it and then dismissed the issue and did nothing. 
i have seen scarier mortgage rates #itmovie #pennywise 
@ twinsprez where’s bucky’s pic - really you should have a platinum space for him. @ twins 
i hope you senators and congressmen aren't getting paid for shutting down our government only seems fair....

i was also offered 2 tequila shots and declined them!!! who am i? 
@ bubbas_33 called your restaurant in greenwood, in and first "mildred" hung up on me.... then i asked if the restaurant shows cbs sports and was very rudely told no. 
well thanks to greedy @ directv and @ cbs, i had to get @ hulu to watch my nfl games and shows. unbelievable how awful directv and cbs are and both have horrible customer service! i will make sure all my friends and family know how money hungry you both are 
hardly any of you boys reacted to my video. did you not like it? #sad #nofun 
although i liked your shellac promo @ purenailbar this is probably the worst mani i have ever had. cuticles poorly cut and shellac already starting to peel 2 days in 
@ flipkartsupport pls initiate the refund guys 
@ markruffalo turned out to be a real ahole. 
i felt great waking up. i got up and made rae a sandwich for work and came right back to bed because i couldnt stop sneezing and my nose got runny all over again. 
@ channel4 trying to watch #hunted on all 4 and it's buffering every few minutes. gutted, can't watch it like this :( not a problem with my internet. why can't you download on desktop like bbc iplayer? 
600 people out of 15k people could do the clubhouse tour. that’s 4% which is unacceptable. charge more money allow less people & do it over 2 days would be the best idea. bought tickets for my father in law for christmas and sold him on the idea of doing the tour 
at a “sports bar” called the break in charleston, sc that doesn’t carry hurricanes hockey games #lame #fakesportsbar #redvolution 
@ wsbradio would love local notifications, but not about sports. just ruined the game i was watching on delay. . please consider limiting alerts to emergencies or i may have to turn them off. 
don’t buy the @ instax square 10 camera. it has way too many things wrong with it. 
#failedtopreserve is just another #fbi lie! we all know they pulled out the burn bags for these creeps. people need to be fired and clean this crap up! we all want to believe in a just govt again yet once again, .

@ debenhams is your bride of 2018 open to same sex couples? it doesn’t seem like it is from the t&c’s #discrimination 
what?! sad there wasn’t a treat waiting for us tonight in our room:( @ thesavoylondon 
life is to short to be rude, sassy, sexy and erotic guys like you makes it all worthwhile to me, one of my friends has just been suspended, makes me feel and #sad. i am here for my friends, the fun, ride and to meet new friends xx 
seriously. @ msutomizzo you have been my favorite ncaa coach for 25 years. and i live in tx. imagine if this was happening to your players. would you be conflicted? would you wonder if they "got the right guy"? … 
and i am still waiting for you to pick me up. 
okay, i usd the taco bell app to order dinner thinking it would make it a little faster. they asked me to pull up and my food would be right out. as the 4th car that came in after pulls around me, i'm think this was a horrible idea. #tacobell 
i am happy these women and men stood by their promises to us. their word still means something. sad that quality is so rare in our government today thank you for your service 
wh claims victory on shutdown: what the president did clearly worked he should take a victory lap, democrats look stupid for caving in. #smh 
@ housedemocrats i’m very disappointed that you caved to the gop. the dreamers deserve better. the #gop care nothing for them. all the #gop wants to do is expel anyone that has a skin color other than white! #afraid4america 
wow... if you can’t it, i can’t help you. though you’re obviously opposite my political ideology you’ve always seemed to be honest about some of the shortcomings. racism has been one of the clearest stances 45 always demonstrated long b4 he even ran. 
i know a lot of u were invested but just so you’re aware, no one had a candle pass at meeting. #dropping?

do people ever ask men to smile????? hmm..ya, i didn't think so. … 
3 more anxiety riddled weeks for daca recipients while ice brings terror to communities? in exchange for an empty, breakable “promise” from politicians who have repeatedly lied? this sent a horrible message to dreamers that they weren’t impt enough to fight for! 
beat the team who will almost certainly win the league - then lose to a team who will almost certainly go down. life as a liverpool fan. #lfc we were dreadful tonight. 
now, #lfc pretend like trying to sign someone (to stop fans meltdown) and do it till jan 31 and say we tried but the deal didn't went through. seriously, we are gonna bottle it and we have only ourselves to blame. i'm not even surprised. this is us. @ lfc 
had terrible customer service from @ nikonusa today. expected much more 
if he is found guilty of these allegations i can't say that i'd be surprised. enzo is his own worst enemy. being in trouble with his own peers and getting in trouble outside the ring. his huge ego may have finally caught up to him.

@ senatorcollins so sad to see that even you have been turned against what is right for our country. #youcan'ttrusttrump 
why do you have different internet providers on different @ virginatlantic flights? this is absurd. i had to pay for full-flight access twice because @ gogo did not work, but @ viasatinc was on offer. @ richardbranson please fix this mess. #brandingfail

have always loved @ g_eazy until i realized half his new album is just his negative political opinions. i realize you might getting fans by that way, but i hope you realize you’re losing them just as easily. music is not the place for politics

just watching the #cadelroadrace coverage on tv. love the pictures of our great city of geelong and surrounds. hate how melbourne is plastered all over the advertising though. they only want to know us when there's a buck in it. #livelovegeelong 
pitt basketball is 0-9 and don't look to be improving. it begs the question why exactly was jamie dixon fired again. i mean stallings isn't bringing any better talent into the program obviously. 
@ applesupport i've been on hold for ages and i selected option #2 for classic music to listen too while on hold but all i've heard is asian music. what happened to western classic music? 
@ deltaco when someone orders chili cheese fries, with extra chili- normally you add chili! #deltacofails #deltaco 
@ asdaserviceteam @ yoplait have massively shown up your customer service as im sure package was sealed before i opened means its prob a issue with how your store has kept them... 
@viaplaylatvija paid the money for the briedis vs usyk fight only to see that viaplay can not handle the traffic 
disappointing and very disturbing. #disgraceful … 
hey @ dominoscanada just picked up my pizza, got home and it’s wrong! 
thanks @ fedexoffice for doing a really sloppy job on cutting/binding a brand new @ firstaidteam book, then being completely rude to me when i pointed it out. @ fedexhelp 
make a schedule and stick to it. this just shows your priorities and i hope your network doesn’t get such a highly anticipated event in the future. or at least have the red carpet available to stream online. #wtf 
i thought we were talking about kesha but apparently it was "cassius." @ mtbooble 
@ emirates really with #businessclass on ek449. 17hrs long no sleepers no pyjamas only 2 white & red wine . then piled in overcrowded #lounge @ qatarairways m coming back to you 
@ vanjones68 the debut of your show was very surprising. you gave a national voice to someone who cheated on his wife, slapped her sister, made millions off treating women like sex slaves and hurls racial slurs on a daily basis. 
not everything on twitter is true 
can’t believe i thought you were a decent person. gave @ presssec benefit of doubt, too. you graduated from the same graciousness academy as @ potus. #truecolors #thoughtyouwereraisedbetter #christianvalues 
@ jetblue the bos to lga route needs serious improvement. sitting on the tarmac again for 45mins. still haven’t left scheduled to leave at 5:30. what gives ???? # 
the #uber god view lesson didn't give #lyft the learn. #privacy 
eric, i’ve always been a huge fan of your work, (not to mention having a huge crush on you through most of my twenties!) i fully respect your right to your beliefs but this tweet strikes me as incredibly petty. 
hard hitting direct questions piers,shame you didn’t drill him for direct answers! weak and not to your usual standard 
@ pizzahut went to place order online and discovered you are now charging an extra charge for pan pizza. since when did this start? #disappointed#orderingpapajohns 
my brothers and my parents put some mustard in between the oreo cookies and put them in my room. i was walking downstairs to put them in the cupboard, and i ate one and freaked out. i made them pay by throwing the package on the floor and making a mess. 
no changing station in the "family" bathroom, @ dulles_airport? 
if @ jj_hairston does not win the grammy for #youdeserveit im going to be this was one of the best gospel songs of the year! 
you backed out on the challenging questions #piersmorgan was expecting more of you … 
gabby had a great tournament. the team didn’t. don’t be proud of poor performances and not qualifying. do not praise mediocrity. demand more from the program and your teammates. #congratshaiti 
@ americanair why are you giving my parents such a hard time to use a voucher after they gave up their first class seats . it shouldn't be so difficult #americanairlines #help 
@ verizon @ vzwsupport so we finally get an amazing promotion for the iphone x then the “catch” hits us hard! why do we need to activate a new line if we don’t need it? doesn’t make sense. i was momentarily excited. 
all these years being a @ laclippers fan. i don’t understand this move. waited all these years for some excitement. first chris paul and now blake griffin. let me guess dj and lou are next . 
i wouldn't pay the "cheap" rate they do in the offseason anymore unless it goes down even more. if this dropped 2 months ago i def would've moved. debating on using a freebie into xs. coming from a @ wynnlasvegas fanboy 
i have lost all respect. what the heck is this. #confusion … 
whenever miley cyrus performs there should always be a cat crying diamonds in the background #grammys 
every bad driver i have seen today have all been women! come on ladies but the fucking lip stick down and learn to drive 
@ therealstanlee i have been a fan of your comics since i was a child. i have to let you know that your @ stanleebox is horrible. no where near the value. are you still involved with these boxes? if so, you need to talk with them, the value is not there. #sucks 
the most exciting part of my evening was the rainforest cafe. 
i find it very upsetting that i finally get some mandarin oranges and was so excited to finally have one l, then when i did it was as sour as piss. i am pretty sure a bag of sour patch kid candies are sweeter then these things! 
i'm more surprised by the fact that culture didn't win album of the year. #grammys2018 
i got this magazine recently. a little i didn't make the cut... 
same here, utterly disappointed kashif...today ur show was agenda based...no balance out of all people u found @ aajkamrankhan to talk media credibility / ethics? the man who used to take 7000/month from mi in 1991/92 as a mole? @ _mansoor_ali @ xadeejournalist 
just watched few minutes of #supergirl on tv, omg. the level of cringe is over 9000. i’ve seen better acting in porn. btw. that’s not how #physics work. it’s funny how they say supergirl every few seconds. original #powerrangers are masterpiece for this xd 
we were hoping for @ beyonce tribute to mark e. smith at the grammys last night 
@ tacobell what kind of mexican pizza is this 
yeah... tried to check this out last sunday. called all day to book. no answer. drove from preston so fig we jst turn up jst to be told fully booked all day but there were about 6 people drinking/dining, most tables empty. #wastedjourney 
i’ve gone to the gym like four times this week and i don’t look like a model yet. 
@ xfinity @ comcastcares there’s no money back guarantee for anyone. it’s a lie, false advertising even if you cancel within 30days. #noguarantee #customersdontcount 
where's the balance @ jeffglor ? not #fakenews but perhaps something worse. in your news line tonight. we really need and want you to succeed but not this way. @ cbseveningnews on the way to #failure 
stop expecting others to ‘play fair’ or ‘do the right thing’. your morals & ethics often will not be the same as other people. 
#hpsupport man what is wrong today? takes me to ibm at first, now it’s hung. 
#mood #annoyed #donedoingfavors 
gestede? oh wait, he shouldn’t be playing professionally. 
#silentwitness really and agitated with tonight’s episode. clarissa wouldn’t be that stupid to put herself in that predicament 
the @ bbcone have really f**ked up , @ brendancole is a massive part of strictly and everything it stands for .... time to say bye bye to @ theantondubeke , he’s never been a strictly winner 
hey @ hyundai i'm in for my first service appointment for my new 2017 #ioniq. in my first 4000 miles i only got 44 mpg instead of the advertised 57 mpg... what's up with that? 
4th time my @ deliveroo guy does not come to my house, unresponsive, can't order any more food (cause 22.3o, obvs.) and i get my money back.... i just want food, jesus! (fish &chips to be accurate) how hard can it be?! #why #sad #deliveroo 
not using @ snapchat anymore. new update is rubbish. where are all my friends stories, and why is it now cluttered with the stories of people i’m not even following. #snapchatupdate 
@ savannahguthrie was so rude to you this morning. i wouldn’t give the @ todayshow the time of day. #norespect #rude 
had the same thought and was skimming through the article looking for confirmation. 
damn! @ nbcthisisus this is us will be pre-empted tonight by #sotu when 45 will woodenly read from a teleprompter. … 
it was bad enough that #nffc sent tickets to my dad who passed away last january when i had already informed them, not to mention my brother having to endure that match with me after being told to keep the ticket 
are you kidding? my daughter will think about changing to a different college in the fall. she was accepted into the lyman briggs honors college. now with this announcement, we will see. #msu 
remind me again why this terrible governor is a correspondent on abc news? #disappointed&confused 
frances - not sure if he has done a smart thing recusing himself from #russiancollusion and felt hugely unfair to our president - i simply think he shouldn’t have accepted the role or even appointed rod rosenstein- i think he should resign 
trying to find a light-saber mod for shadow of mordor / shadow of war #disappointing #videogames 
rippo. made the trip for nothing :/ #disappointed. 
left feeling very let down by an unacceptable ending to #kiri if this is the contempt #channel4 has for it's viewers i won't be investing in future short dramas. very 
ordered a @ jimmyjohns sandwich your guy made it wrong. tastes awful 
@ abcmelbourne i agree jon 'doomed' esp after i went to uk in 2006 and was appalled that bbc etc was lower brow than aus tv 
i try to give you a compliment and bang.... 
why?! @ channing_frye should start! 
just by looking at this "road map" i believe @ destinythegame & @ bungie just lost a customer as soon as iron banner is over its going to be untouched until the next dlc comes out. glad i have @ thedivisiongame and @ forhonorgame … 
what the hell! talk about most worst ending ever.... what a waste of time #kiri 
frustration only,defended for 90 mins was not an enjoying game for a fun like me. 
has #kiri been all about the brother trying to sound and act as strange as possible throughout...? #redherringsaplenty 
should there be prison time for brenda fitzgerald? #brendafitzgerald #cdc … 
@ eatsummerlin very mediocre food at #lvmkt2018 #lvmkt 
in giroud's mind... he saw going to a better place... he saw hope ahead... 
jay-z should had won at least one grammy 
@ coachtrip unfortunately there is absolutely no one left that i care about winning or getting voted off 
well, we've been outside and looked at this superbluebloodmoon and it looked liked a moon-sized moon. moon-ish. 
hey @ tacobell where's the "bell grande"? i think someone missed the mark #disappointment 
aye maybe so, but still no scottish dates for your show danny 
yeah, i def supported your presidential run! unfortunately, after your hateful rhetoric during the last presidential election, you lost my respect & support. it's not who i thought you were! 
why doesn’t ddimb stop men shouting at & shouting down women panelists. aka mr angry (brexiter) shouting down justine greening. grr! not sure david dimb ‘sees’ the issue. #disappointed. 
@ 3hl1045 speaking of ticket price increases, heard today the preds are doing a significant price increase. possibly tripling prices. #stickingtotheloyalfans 
what about a video of the c-47 actually in flight though. … 
questionable decision to be at the trial. misplaced loyalty no doubt but the optics are appalling from the national team captain. 
well after some serious investigating the girl is actually real and very much not a ghost 
waiting for #rising sun but never came. realised i had only part completed the pledge manager. feeling stupid but heard quite a few made same mistake. maybe a case of poor ui design? or maybe i was just clumsy on the ipad. no response yet from @ cmongames. 
when i watch a great railway journey show i kinda expect railways and trains to feature extensively... not tourist shit i could see via bus, car, bicycle, foot.... #greatamericanrailwayjounreys #fuckyou 
justine greening had the perfect opportunity to do a geoffrey howe there, but singularly failed to do so. #bbcqt 
@ delta sprint to my connection gate atl c42 just now. #missedconnection agent jane and coworker abrasively tell me why they can’t help, why not smile and take 60 seconds to rebook me? minutes later i get notification my bag #madetheearlyflight i just missed. 
i’m the type of girl that works out for a week and expects a six pack. #instantsixpack 
today just wasn’t a productive day i have a major headache and no motivation to do a bit extra #tomorrowisanewday 
did anyone watch kiri? how is that ending acceptable? @ jackthorne did you just get fed up and stop, get a new story or pen ran out of ink? surely someone read the script back and asked, "where's the ending?" #kiri #kiriending 
i sure wish it would have let me upgrade my shipping online or even when i called customer service. looks like i am going to have to find a different party favor now. 
so i guess #smoshwintergames isn't happening 
all this #hype for a mascara @ benefitbeauty get real! and come out with something worth the hype 
you have doomed us all 
. @ itv2hounds why the repeated challenges this ep? i love your show but there's definitely been a decline in challenge quality and scariness, and since you've insisted on featuring reality stars instead of normal people, a substantial dumbing down of challenges 
my professor asked if anyone still watched indiana jones and no one raised their hand #amiold? 
i guess loyalty means nothing anymore 
my concern is that we don’t have all the facts. @ devinnunes memo does not show the totality of the fisa application so i don’t agree with his opinion. the attacks on the fbi are unnecessary & unwarranted. it leaves me thinking djt is hiding somethings 
well i wont be buying @ lidluk crisps again "cheese & onion " - not a hint of flavour friday night ruined!!! 
he told he he was gonna take me out to eat tonight too. 
@ willhurd i have very, very disappointed in your actions. before your interview with wb, i viewed you as a moderate and reasonable gop member. now, it's clear that you are playing politics just like the rest of the party. 
bought a book on ibooks. the formatting is terrible. there are no spaces between many words making it really hard to read. i can let stuff like this go for free ebooks, but i paid $7.99. #bookworm 
i ordered a @ dyson v8 absolute #vacuum from @ lowes. i did receive a dyson v8 box from @ westphillylowes, but it contained a used dc44 with a filthy head. #fraudalert 
budget 2018 is disappointing to say the least. however, i will never ever vote for congress..not in million years. everybody who actually gives a crap about india would never support congress. #budgetsession

lads, just watched that movie get out - not bad but the “twist” was bloody obvious very early on and surely that lady cop should have investigated the fact this tsa officer had seemingly found a missing person no matter what the person’s story. 
i appreciate your reporter specifies that the threshold for fisa courts is high & dossier is only 1 piece (not totality)clearly we don’t have all the facts & we need 2 see the fisa paperwork....so i don’t agree with the opinion that their was misuse: 
it’s sad that having a good heart is considered a weakness now-a-days 
happy birthday #wuntu, thanks for the hot chocolate but unfortunately cake was all gone @ valeriecafe

saw an article about @ tmnt @ nickelodeon just cuz youre the biggest does not make you the strongest, nor does it make you a leader. what kind of message does that send to children out there especially girls. leadership is wisdom, balance, logic, sacrifice. #tmnt 
@ ncaupdates @ varsityallstar did you have to hold cheer awards to put down a dance floor, why not wait until after awards?

@ babybel i bought these yesterday... umm these are good for 7 months? just an fyi they are spoiled and taste awful! #babybel 
i was kind of bummed nobody at work was talking about the #superbowl today. usually that's all we talk about at work on #superbowlsunday there. 
@ girlscouts shrunk the cookies, over baked them, and raised the price. 
ordered @ pizzahut wings for #superbowl and had almost no buffalo sauce. 
@ costco filled up with gas at your brainerd location. only savings was 3 cents a gallon. not worth going out of my way. 
once when i was really young my family was going on vacation so i made a really nice crayon drawing sign that i intended to tape to our front door to let everyone know we werent gonna be home and i showed my mom and she was like wtf r u trying to get us robbed??

the fmla is a great act and was well done by then president clinton. it is such a shame that his legacy is that of sexual harassment and assault, further blackened by your corrupt and deceitful actions. 
@ hillaryclinton seriously mrs clinton, you had your chance and you blew it with your deceit, your corruption and, well, your political games. i had such hopes... 
@ bbcnews please note there is no such country as ‘southern ireland’. the public rely on you for decent reliable information - get the basics right at least 
that this is who you have become. sorry i supported your work. 
that moment when you take your first sip of your venti @ starbucks cold brew with 2% milk, and all you taste is sweetener (then you check the label and it reads iced coffee with 2%-and no mention of sweetener)

flying @ spiritairlines for the first time and highly disappointed. there is a snow storm here in detroit. we have to sit on the plane until it’s de-iced for over an hour. the least they could do is provide water or snacks.... always trying to make a buck.

deeply disappointed that @ bankofamerica does not value me as a customer after 18 yrs. closing my account now. #bankofamerica #unreasonablefees 
50 shades freed was truly a let down. if you've read the books (3 times like me) you will be so disappointed. they missed so much and important scenes weren't done justice #50shadesfreed

luna was excited to try her first burrow toy but it started shedding after only 5 minutes of play! she sure loves the squeaky birds but i've had to confiscate the tent for her safety @ 
@ kimguilfoyle you are unfairly unloading on general kelly. how can you say he encouraged ms hicks to date rob porter? he said he fired him 40 mins after seeing the pictures. as a former prosecutor you should always promote the principle of presumption of innocence. 
what the f*** snapchat. i did not tell you to download the new version by yourself! 
for a recent football fan, it’s going to be hard to remain loyal to @ calstampeders when they are letting so many of my favourites go: @ jmessam @charl3stonchew @ _mcdaniel16 why so drastic? 
when you open snapchat and suddenly it’s the new update #fml #snapupdate 
so again, no praise for #bhafc on #motd can’t believe the team goal didn’t even get a mention! #bhafc 
hey @ netflix or @ amazon it's black history month. how about celebrating it by making videos available, like documentaries or movies based on true stories (selma, loving, hidden figures)? have featured categories to celebrate & educate about history/awareness months. 
@ cbcolympics im disappointed with the coverage too many repeats & conversations not enough of the athletes. on demand has nothing in it. 
so much negativity in this house. it’s as if being positive is impossible. when it really isn’t. 
the new update on @ snapchat blowsssss. 
@ thedrybar still waiting for my 3pm appointment in vegas 21 min later that i booked ages ago 
was hoping to see #kevinayres on guitarheroesatthebbc on @ yesterdaytweets … 
i am here at the retirement ceremony for #vl4 and i am super disappinted @ lakings for not coming out... not even one player and he finished his career in la 
when your partner has been looking forward all day to trying the new grand big mac but the local @ mcdonaldsuk has sold out of burgers! seriously your macdonalds #notverygood #whodoallthepromo 
i can’t believe this. i’m pretty outraged right now. i just wanted a nice deck to observe on. i almost told @ jakerummel to stop by. glad i didn’t. what’s up @ portofseattle?!? … 
su i played chalupa today & didn’t win anything 
tried to go to @ alunauk 2nite for a nightcap before train home. husband stopped to open the door for me & told by bouncer he wasn't allowed in cause"he hit the wall". sorry he misjudged a wall due to #dyspraxia. thx, never returning again. #disabilitydiscrimination 
@ kroger my sister has been getting coupon books from you guys like crazy....what about me?!?!?!...i am just as much a member as she is...could it be because we reside at the same address that you guys decided to stop sending them to me?.. 
i was all pumped about the new h-mart in chicago’s west loop, but gave up after noticing the parking lot (of perhaps 30 spots?) was full and some people parked as if they owned a lambo. yes, even some city people need to drive to get to you. #frustrated 
sorry for getting my hopes up and thinking things would be different this time dad. #whydoibother 
last week #kiri then #hardsun and latest #requiem watched them all. each one is as if someone started writing then ‘couldn’t be arsed’ finishing it. went to the pub/cinema/next sale. and left it to their 14 year old sibling. 
#jessherring #thevoiceuk how did nobody turn for jess ... she was amazing ... keep doing what you’re doing .. 
waited on hold for 25 minutes with @ apple to talk for two minutes to reserve a battery that won't be available for two weeks. my battery dropped from 90 to 53% just while waiting. and #unimpressed 
how has no one put micheal jackson in @itsshangelas jerry curl pop corn fantasy yet?? 
ordered a create your own burger @ zinburgereast messed up my order which i’m fine with because mistakes happen. sent the burger back expecting a fresh new one like i ordered. instead i get the same burger with leftover condiments the staff tried to scrape off. 
giving celebrity big brother a chance but kinda disappointed in the cast. mostly washed up reality tv stars and musicians.. 
@ kvjshow i went to paws in the park today to have a pet portrait taken with @ producerdennys talking cat but it was nowhere to be found! what's up with that p-dizzle? #hello #ohwow #ohwell 
@ settlersofcatan just bought your app for $4.99, how do i get my money back? doesn’t work, @ applesupport 
check out my activity rings from february 10, 2018 on my #applewatch i didn’t close my rings yesterday 
as much as i depend on your products and think they all great and do the job as it says on label- what's happening with the "oven and cookware cleaner" i've gone from paying £1 for a 500g tub to paying £1 for a mere tiny 150g tub @ astonishcleaner 
so much for ordering that next case of wine @ laithwaites 
want to get my son a teepee but my husband think we should just buy a normal play tent as they are cheaper. my dream of sitting with my son in his teepee with books isn't going to happen 
i was hoping for a comprehensive survey of kitty tummies. 
@ snapchat, although you have streamlined your app, it has made your app less appealing for consumers. it is is now a brand-heavy platform, where non-compelling stories clog my feed. i don’t even know most of the people you try to promote. 
i just discovered that john cusack blocked me and i don’t know why. i’ve never trolled him and i feel my beliefs are close to his. #johncusack 
i wanted to get a cookie from the grocery store. i saw the girl scouts hanging out in front of store selling their cookies. then decided not to get any cookies and walked away. i still want a cookie. #indecisive 
i fucking untied my zip on shoes last night wtf 
this has been a very under performing winter. all this cold and no snow. 
hey, #snapchat me again. i just don’t understand why you thought making messaging was a priority. ur about seeing stories. that’s what makes you dope. well, used to be... #annoyed 
well ive waited weeks for this & its a pile of shit 
@ texasroadhouse great food today but mediocre service. 
most of my morning has been looking for/at alligators and after leaving i realized i didn’t quote steve irwin once!! talk about your all time blown opportunity’s 
@ vodafoneuk how come i’m seeing so many people getting treats?! i’ve been with you for years & not had one! also my contract technically ended 5months ago & thought i might have been offered a new deal by now #hello 
@ applesupport is absolutely useless!!! they never respond and provide zero help. #useless 
waited 3 weeks and all day for my new patio furniture to be delivered to complete my screened in porch project... and today i got the complete wrong color! @ costco #costcofail #customerservicefail 
it even looks wrong. 
"i got your picture i'm coming with you!" screamed 13 year-old me somewhere from deep within the confines of the #cosmos as i saw this tweet and i couldn't stop myself. i dunno if i should feel with myself or feel hella … 
this school holiday was thinking about taking the kids to the chocolate factory, after seeing @ thelululife insta i have changed my mind... #chocolatefactory before i even go!! 
@ woodmansfood when is my tweet about items that are days past expiration date being sold? reduced price sticker was placed over where the expiration sticker. chicken, peppers and pico de gallo etc were all rotted in the package. #dotherightthing 
hey @ mcdonalds!!! what’s the deal? styrofoam cups > plastic cups! #fixit #bringbacktheoldcups 
haha. it was very evident that the research team/writers do not understand bitcoin or blockchain based on what was shown tonight. awfully uninformed and a show @ bbcpanorama is likely to regret. you have certainly lost credibility. 
when your @ wawa sub is drenched in sauce #sad #annoyed 
not very believable, a normal person wouldn’t blame the doctor but the person with the knife. 
#expected 
fifty shades of not very good is my opinion of what i watched today @ vickyg_78 enjoyed it though so 
not liking this i should have empathy with the father but his focus on the dr doesn’t ring the least bit true he’d be after the attacker first #trauma 
@ briandunseth @ johnharkes6 i thought wynalda, martino, solo and even gans would have been excellent choices. i thought we were getting change? 
went to grab a coffee in city creek and you just vanished going to miss you all. 
thanks @ snapchat 
i'm sorry that #metoo doesn't know how to write about the important, inspirational, and amazing things that your say. 
@ jetblue can you tell me why we are so delayed from #newark to #boston? as a courtesy, it would be greatly appreciated if you gave updates. #noinfo makes it hard to plan 
when you go to @ krispykreme day before #valentines and they are out of valentine doughnuts. is that smart? 
does @ espncricinfo know that ppl use their app to look at the score or the news and not for ads! an ad pops up every 5 seconds. very annoying and ends in uninstalling! #cricket #espncricinfo 
@ doddle disappointed with service and lack of reply via email. order a delivery and was supposed to be delivered today and had no tracking up date or sign of parcel #letdown 
we stood up for @ thebushcenter when dixie chicks trashed them overseas, now he does same thing to @ potus #whyidroppedout 
it's gon be sum #valentinesday #specials cuz nigguz didnt come thru wit da #goods 
so i've been super excited to hear 'never seen anything...' live since i saw @ thescript have been playing it on they're #freedomchildtour and they didn't even play it #nightruined #nottingham 
so no giant dick sporting good then? 
#notsurprised … 
only 26 this year! so sorry, i've let my talent slide - i'll try harder next year 
@ enterprise .... the company with too few employees to pick you up! 
#survivalofthefittest is like getting up on a thursday thinking it's friday #loadofoldshit 
wondering if anyone else lost their ticket cost due to the strikes in december? apparently icelandair isn’t going to give me anything back after a cancelled flight? i am #shocked i had to book with another airline #icelandair 
@ popeyescanada bought a b up *yup brand* cinnamon roll protein bar today.....i cannot even describe the fluffy lightly cinnamon flavored cardboard that i took a bite of! what a horrible bar and for almost $4....i am totally thrown off!! 
frig. i thought this was going to be a picture of me and @noahxzelle 
@ costcoauto when looking for a @ jeep rubicon and you don’t have dealers in the area, a kia sorento is not a comparable vehicle. your algorithms are a little off. 
how about just “support creators” why does the color of ones skin dictate if i should subscribe to them? 
does every company shaft their employees? #assumeposition #shafted 
seriously, blade runner 2049. wbat was the point. #wasteofmytime 
i really was hoping for some sweet malice when i read that title 
@ dominos_uk i am waiting for pizza that i ordered close to 9:45... it’s now nearly 11:20 and not only do i not have a pizza but it’s saying it’s still prepping... not even cooking! #hungry #hangry 
the #mountaindewice just tastes like watery 7-up... there's nothing new about this.. 
that’s it? #michiganthing 
only saw one valentine's day proposal today. 
#disappointed; feeding the warmonger beast :( 
cream cheese shortage at @ panerabread ?!?! you can keep the bagel. 
hey, @ sencorygardner , remember when i asked what legislation you'll be proposing to curtail school shootings? please know you should stop cashing those nra checks if your proposal goes beyond a national day of "thoughts and prayers". i won't hold my breath. … 
@ trespass really disappointed. followed washing instructions on coat and it's ruined, all the filling split and in lumps! #goingtobecoldtomorrow 
poor script development, pacing, choice of importance of secondary characters...and it's oscar nominated lots of great things about the film but how does a film get that much £ without the basics being covered. 
for the last 15 years i have had a valentines card from a secret admirer......you know what?.. i was really sad that i didn't get one this year.....first my grandmother dies... now this! #sadvalentine 
why are you praying to god? the gods didn't shoot anybody, that would be a gun @ nra to take b/c u can damwell afford it. if #congress #pass concealed carry nationwide...could u imagine the outcome? every kid with a gun. it would be a bloodbath. wake up! w/ 
totally agree, talk about being built up & knocked down, great guests for some but hardly the best line up of all time as quoted previously mmmm not what it says on the can @ showmasters 
highly disappointed in the liverpool central school district and @ markmpotter17 for making a decision about our graduation without letting us have our say or letting our parents have a say. 
@ hyvee is there a reason why mega deals are 6 items? you don't give me much incentive to shop with you 
. @ handlestore as previously stated please do not use these people they take your money and hide behind policy in terms of not offering a refund and when pushed offer credit note but do not sell my size handles #useless #badseller 
@ bitmoji where are the #blackpanther items?!? 
first all black cast ever and all hollywood did was to remind us that we have all the natural resources and potential, but all we do is fight against one another to keep our colonial masters happy. #blackpanther 
@ apple iphone x face recognition not working after shaving my beard off 
the train was declared cancelled by station staff at 7:30am.......its been happening for a while now. it’s better to scrap it off the timtable rather than causing delays for commuters. 
@ greggsofficial this is not a toastie! this is a heated dry ham sandwich with hard cheese on the outside #nomeltedcheese 
i swear i don’t know one single nice genuine guy like i honestly could not name one guy that i know personally that isn’t a chauvinistic self obsessed silly little boy what has this world come to? 
thank you to the person who thought it was ok to not stop but go ahead and run over jaxons basketball and pop it! then just keep going and not stop. #rudepeople 
tried red robin take out for the first time. i got a chicken caesar wrap with a side of fries. guess what was not in my wrap when i took my first bite. the chicken! 
@ cater2me - your service canceled a lunch order for a 30-person meeting today at the last minute - citing "technical difficulties" leaving our team with no food. #hungry 
in the @ honest company. latest shipment was 2 weeks late and it arrived like this... hope this trend doesn’t 
@ ticketmaster how can your app and your customer service number have different responses to take care of my issue? and how are you not responsible for what is sold on your website?! 
sorry @ softmocshoes you've now lost a family worth of custom. i will not be making any purchases from your stores/online stores in the future. #badcustomerservice 
@ fly540aviation severly disappointed in the lack of professionalism and lack of follow up. this airline has not done anything to assist my group and jas caused so many problems for us. #annoyed #whatajoke #notahappycustomer 
got a reply and i’m offered 400usd for 1200usd worth of luggage... 
its been ages you and nokia 8 camera is still below average.. ! you guys promised an updated app but nothing as yet. ! @ sarvikas 
apparel...but warning for other ladies...the build-your-own hoodie (nfl shop) runs very small. can’t return mine cause it’s “customized”. definitely not a large. @ fanatics @ shopnfl trying to sell it for what i 
the @ charmedaroma bath bombs are absolutely terrible. the do not smell nice and the dye in them stains everything. not recommended even a little bit #messy #charmedaroma 
bring back the old version of movie pass. the new one is useless. now, i can't see the new black panther. #whyfixsomethingthatwasntbrokenbeforebutnowis @ moviepass 
finally saw thor ragnarok, i cannot believe people love this movie. they absolutely ruined characters from planet hulk, ruined the whole storyline of one of the greatest comic series. all for cheap gags, even the fight scenes are hot trash. 
when you’re trying to upgrade your seat on @ aircanada rouge but everyone’s telling you they can’t upgrade you (to empty seats and willing to pay) even when you’re visibly too tall to fit in yours. #neveragain – bei montréal int'l airport pierre-elliott-trudeau (yul) 
@ starbuckscanada i’m very disappointed that i was told i can’t reload my card i can only do it on my app. #notgood #badcustomerservice 
why is @ foxnews saying that the russian indictments are involving the trump campaign. clearly ag rr said that they were meddling with polictics in general. for and against all parties. they are spinning. 
i tried so hard @ brunomars to get tickets in toronto. i'm not into tech, but @ ticketmaster makes no sense. waited 2hrs kept getting "please wait, don't refresh or you'll lose you place in line" then none of the prices were within @ ticketmaster listed price range. 
this is an @ nra wet dream. #sosad #voteoutthenra 
hey @ moviepass where is my card? #frustrated 
#flashbackfriday #fridayfeeling rage, rage against the dying of the light* *dying of the light = people who get in front of you in the queue, mash their bum tightly up against your frontside, start to grind, then fart, and leave like nothing ever happened. 
groves! needs to know junior down a peg or two.. all down to respect whoever your component is and he has none and neither does his dad 
well i for one will no longer be watching that site. you were my prime reason for going there! #theirloss #yourethegreatesttop 
omfg jus caught @ bluerush1992 snorting a line 2 days after he was released & finished rehab. 
#blackpanther is politically driven. robs the very essence out of the film. #sad , i can see what @ marvel will do in phase 4. it's probably going to be a politically correct nightmare. yearning to watch old greats like "bad boys" or "blade". 
forcing people is not the way to achive the victory, as you are enslaving your citizens. not in favour of this reform. #historyatvasco 
how ridiculous is this? we ordered hawaiian pizza to the edge and it was cut up into ridiculous little squares. @ pizzahut what were you thinking? #ruined 
well if anyone needs a baby shower or birthday cake for a baby named ennerson you can have one. because @ samsclub in johnson city, tn can’t really tell the different between one m and two ns. my kids names is emerson. along w/ 18 other things wrong with this cake. 
too messy tonight! eubank could've done so much better he was hurting groves just never followed through and those swings were too wild. made groves look good and he didn't really do anything that i'd expect from him either #groveseubank 
i got an orioles puzzle for christmas. waited til spring training to work on it. opened it up and my baltimore orioles camden yards puzzle had st louis cardinals busch stadium inside #orioles #masterpiecesinc beyond words 
such a shame fans had to miss out thanks to @ itvboxoffice bad service, paid and didn't get to watch. 
@ chriseubankjr just shows... you can hit the bag as fast as you want, but you were outclassed. not a single flourish. 
any one else feel like @ attcares @ att have the worst customer service ever, from the csr, billing, to the social media team? been a customer for years, guess is time to check out @ verizon #ylietho #attsuck #switchup 
and the worse @ thekeg location is in #oakville & trafalgar. my steak had absolutely no flavor - yuck! management wanted to make it up so we picked a free dessert to go. we asked for plain cheesecake & we got cherry sauce all over it. #horriblelisteningskills 
@ super8hotels double charged me for a room and nobody seemed to know what they were doing. won't be staying there again 
how dare @ arcticmonkeys do european dates first, without pleasing the british public. been waiting forever! #noton #dobritishdates #goinggrey 
sooooo uber eats don’t deliver to pv... 
i love honda! been driving since 2010! wanted more than base model only to find out, that i can’t unless i get leather. 
when you book a great sounding package at @ embassysuites in niagara falls and it’s a giant rip off 
@ cphillipsfour love your restaurant but disappointed with the limited veggie options now. @ bigrigbrew 
as a #physicallydisabled woman i’m in @ uber for charging my friends account wait time when we are waiting on the corner & i asked the driver to make a u-turn. unnecessary & insensitive ways to increase the fare #uber #customerexperience 
@ nascar probably shouldn't take green flag racing from the fans at the ends of the stages. seems a bit messed up to me. i want to watch racing not caution laps. #wrong #ripoff 
team lakers should've played my role model @ candace_parker more, could've won 
@ publix what happened to all the tofurkey products. what you’re offering now is more expensive and not nearly as tasty. #publix #tofurkey 
itv box office= no service!!! @ itvboxoffice #letdown #joke 
was out in the open and didn't feel the earth shake 
why does the ranch dressing at cheesecake factory taste sweet? #neveragain 
so in @ sallybeauty... anyone know of another place i can shop for #hairdye? because they’ve lost a couple of customers … 
oh i thought @ kocojessica was going to be there cooking with you. #whatisontv :) 
so upset i missed the tickets for nxt’s april taping also. really sucks. i haven’t really had the money when the tickets were selling. so i’m missing march and april’s full sail tapings. sucks. #fullsaillive #nxt 
@ itv couple of clangers, we really love a good itv drama and #kiri and #trauma were utterly unbelievable in principle and rubbish drama. #losingfaith bring back @ downtonabbey 
well that was super disappointing. i will never have @ qfcgrocery delivery ever again and do not recommend it. #qfcdelivery #notworthit 
my last trip with @ emirates was not very pleasant, having an 18+ hour flight with some issues was not the service i'd expect from #emirates 
forget it @ jcpenny you don't deserve our money with the entire experience. 1) info lacking on line 2) no answer to item question 3) can't get your own item#from link provided 4) #nowthis 
@ freeformtv why do you allow commercials for scary shows like siren to air during a children’s movie? kids don’t need to see this! #doineedtocancel @ uverse 
@ broadcastmoose been through all the tweets for today's game and couldn't see any food photos!!! 
#ifeel #hurt & 
#daytona500 is nothing like cars. 
@ holidayinnexpre @ holidayinn very disappointed with our stay in bath. our room was apparently in the “building site” wing. cold, draughty, musty and not worth the money we paid for the room #holidayinnexpress 
i'm genuinely disappointed that i spent good money and time waiting for @ greazyvegan tonight. i mean it was ok but seriously with basically everything else 
@ eloquii tried on a dress i bought online in january. the dress is 8 (yes, 8!!!!) sizes bigger than i ordered. seriously. 
@ starbucksgold , did your birthday rewards always expire the day after your birthday? i don’t recall this. couldn’t use mine because i was on vacation and it wasn’t a priority. 
cross country skiing cancelled today due to low temperatures, better safe than sorry! #ymmweather #-22c/-29c i am 
you ain’t wrong… 
@ marvel @ theblackpanther not screened in jhansi! #sad 
today is a day that shall live on in #blackhistory for days to come. on this day we shall recognize the blac. for the video of the blac that was released over the weekend. today is the day @ blacchyna has america. 
#dotard jr. & eric won't be there, dragging a dead cheetah on stage as a prop? 
the #cloverfieldparadox is more like a #cloverfieldparody i cannot get over how bad it is. 
i preordered at 4 for 6 using the @ swisschaletca app for the third time. i notice the phone #i changed twice is still wrong and instead of buzzing my unit that is clearly listed, he took my order back & the store voided it! i better get my scene points i used back 
i resemble your comment. i am in the @ nsgov @ zachchurchill for dividing me from my colleagues @ nseducation and #distracting us in moving forward with real solutions in support of #novascotia students. @ nsteachersunion … 
@ moustachenz what are you doing closed on your last week in welly?! 
live feeds are always down is this worth the charge #cbs #cbbcbs 
cant believe that manchester city lost to wigan #manchester #mcfc 
@ flyfrontier - about 40 people in line at sea-tac airport waiting at counter and no representative! 
is @ marilynmilian didn't strongly advise the "it's not a pit bull" owners 2 properly lock up their dog that ripped the fence on @ thepeoplescourt 
hi @ netflix_ca, can you please offer a free month to those who watched open house? it was the worst movie ever. netflix can do way better than this! 
@ netflix why is there no english audio for your new live action full metal alchemist move. 
ditto!!! love scarlett, but her profile pics are just not her ascee know her- 
hubby was sending me a mixed grill from my fav restaurant as he was working close by there tonight. instead of a mixed grill i received a bloody that was like receiving liverpool tickets when i’m actually an arsenal fan!! #pregnacycravings #notworththewait 
#nothappy !!!!!!!! 
fake news. … 
@ rushlimbaugh project orion why are you and the rest of the media ignoring the florida witnesses that say there were multiple shooter? your behind the curve on this one, is it on purpose ? in you

ya girl drank some sleepytime tea and that shit just don’t work 
man i'm just as upset as i bet ol boy is #blacchyna #waccchyna 
i feel sorry for that boy . his parents have allowed him to believe he is something that he very well is not going to be . 
@ wishrblx you do not know how excited you got me 
you'll end up really if you think people will do for you as you do for them. not everyone has the same heart as you... 
well the spoiler scenario has happened before so its not all that shocking...kind if a let down actually. i wonder if they're going make a production out of it. probably. why wouldn't they? 
if you think this looks familiar, it's because i've already tweeted to complain about it, yet @ forbes had the audacity to tweet it again with only white men photographed. for the record, good leaders learn from their mistakes, not repeat them … 
@ walmart come on now. what is this??? why is this acceptable to y’all. it was already a week late and comes damaged?? #walmart 
when was the last time you came to a game seriously? no one knows what job he's asked to do. turned into a keyboard warrior 
also the idea that the left is the only corrupt and manipulative wing is bananas. sadly you seem to just be proud, accepting and pushing the lies the right creates. #bothwingsarefullofshit #libertarian #belessbiased 
update: @ penndotnews will not accept your @ bitmoji selfie for a license photo.... and they also don't allow @ snapchat filters for your identification photo. so that was a bust. now i just have a typical terrorist looking photo on my license #sadday 
i was excited for him to get a full-time ride but i just learned how mindless he is 
do you guys have nothing better to talk about or create since you’ve got back? your content and credibility is lacking #longtimefan 
when someone uses your computer and completely changes everything #messedup 
for your november voting. #vote … 
thank you for replying. £26 refund is nothing when we are £100 out of pocket and & ne does not seem to want to do service recovery. feels like ne don’t really care about their customers & their customers welfare when left stranded in freezing conditions #neglect 
first bad experience with @ disney. stuck on test track for 20 minutes. not one of the 4 cast members we talked to gave a halfway believable apology or offered anything to help. 
back in my day, the prime in “prime burgers” actually stood for premium because of their burgers, now the prime stands for average 
march 13 #thelastjedi comes out for purchase digitally. put differently, on march 13 the first star wars movie i will not buy comes out for digital purchase. 
@ pc_optimum you’ve told me you’d look into the matter of my card not linking to the app for the last 21 days. nobody has looked into the matter and it still doesn’t work 
when you are paid to represent your employer with poise in all social settings/situations, you should uphold your duties at all times. knee jerk reactions are typically not favorable. 
i must have been listening to something different then! @ brits 
i never thought i would live in a world where kfc running out of chicken upset more people than the mass incarceration and mistreatment of an entire group of people... #thethingidontget #kfccrisis 
@ pizzahutdeliver placed an order last wkend, completed the survey with details re late delivery and poor pizza quality and heard nothing. is this right? surely not. 
i haven't heard anyone ask yet how criminals are illegally obtaining firearms. or how we could stop that. why aren't we talking about that? oh yeah, because too busy fundraising, campaigning, and sensationalizing to actually come up with an effective solution. 
the most frustrating part of watching this whole thing. it is obvious who is buttering his bread. #wecandobetter#wemustdobetter#parklandstudentsspeak 
oh wait you aren't watching tng, you are watching that sjwtrek show... lol 
i don't understand doctors. my surgery went well but was not what my insurance approved. he's phrasing it in a way so they will pay for it but that's not what he did. so i guess to get it fixed i will have to get lawyers involved. nothing ever goes my way. 
real talk: why isn’t there a @ sweetgreen in queens, ny?!?! #sad 
i have to say they were the worst brits in histor. #boring #noatmosphere #brits2018 
erm @stormzy1 where was @ mnek tonight on #brits he has talent!!!!! 
@ showcasecinemas watched #blackpanther today at reading screen 2. what was an amazing movie was spoilt by poor sound quality, quite a few people were complaining as they were struggling to hear the vocals. sound was far too low. are there no sound checks done? 
i have spoken to @ toyota @ toyotacustcare and they have created a case. they say i should be hearing back from someone at the location within 48 hours. i will wait and see what happens #badcustomerservice 
@ butlins #butlinsminehead feeling a bit cheated. taylor swift act show was short by 10 mins. she was 5 mins late and finished 5 mins early. 
very disappointing meal tonight at @ wearezizzi. group of 10 and not one of us has a good word to say about the experience. will be emailing the company tomorrow 
they ain’t lying when they say within time true colors will show. 
watching i was a little sad with her reaction. #notcanadian 
thanks @ timhortons always enjoy the coffee grinds...... #coffee #timhortons #disappointed. 
@ netflix how are you gonna put @ swearnet trailer park boys in new releases category and get everyone's hopes up that a new season came out. nothing new. #whosincharge #getyourshittogether 
it’s one thing to put a cereal box away empty, but putting this away empty is a whole other kind of cruel. #whostheculprit 
black panther was overrated, it’s is not as good as some of y’all are saying

disappointing @ rotimodernmed meal. no falafel at foggy bottom location. decided to sub in chicken. got home to find roti chicken in my salad was burnt and inedible. #dinnerfail #bettergocava 
total disappointment with the grand big mac,if you've dropped a burger and bun for the jr mac why don't you add 1 of each to the grand big mac. #shit 
when you order @ panerabread online for 5:15 and don't get it until 5:25 because they had it sitting somewhere else. and not even a sorry or apology. #shady 
just because you dislike someone and don't support them doesn't mean you can talk to them like that. you can't fight hate with hate. be a role model. create change not hatred. 
@amazonvideoin terrible to make prime members pay for an erosnow monthly subscription. eros hardly updates with recent movies on a monthly basis, so we’re being asked to pay for older content that we used to be able to access. whack! @ erosnow 
i didn’t think @ lootcrate could do worse than last month’s crate but then i got this month’s crate today. 
when you go to bite into a chocolate muffin.. and it’s actually a blueberry one.

@ gigglingsquid poor service this evening and food not in my take away bag that i had paid for.. 
insufficient food now that you're home to monitor intake. also why are beans in cans like catfood? #catsoftwitter #spookylittlekitten 
our lovely night away has been ruined by thumping disco music. no courtesy to forewarn us and reception not answering. #poorservice @ glendowerhotel 
@ fortnitegaming why isn’t the moon walk one of the dances for the “space theme” battlepass.

i am ashamed that my family members and ancestors fought for the freedom of america, they shed their blood and lost parts of their bodies and minds to defend the rights and constitution for people who ultimately would give it all up for nothing. #usuck

@ hawaiianair third request for response and still no answer. spent over 4 hours on hold and cannot get an answer to rebook a ticket. #fail 
ordered two pizzas from @ pizzahut today after seeing 50% off advertised on @ nascaronfox. should’ve paid full price and ordered from your competitor! the crust wasn’t cooked and we couldn’t taste sauce on the meat lovers or chicken bacon alfredo. #pizza

@ chickfila nothing worse than coming home with take out expecting to have two spicy deluxe sandwiches with pepper jack to find out you were instead given two regular deluxe with colby jack. 
i just bought this toy made by @ barkshop for @ asktarget and it fell apart less than 60 seconds after i gave it to my cocker spaniel! i really thought for a $10 toy it would be more durable since my dog isn't a power chewer. 
some of her old stuff is decent. i like maybe two songs of her new stuff, but i’m pretty in myself too 
i’ve been checking back for updates.... lol 
what on earth is this black stuff on my @ lays chip??!! is this packet even safe to eat @ pepsico ? i have 3 more packs with the same batch number, now they are going to the bin! 
@ teenvogue i subscribed to your magazine for my daughter because of the great articles. replacing teen vogue with allure is not a good deal. prefer my money back if you're not going to publish any more. 
i would absolutely have traded him for a first and a 1b prospect (not to be confused with a b prospect). i don't think you get a blue chipper, but you get a young cost-controlled good player who's ready maybe now, but latest next year. #unlesstheleafswinthecuplol 
why is it so hard to get a fair track for one and all? i'm disappointed once again. #armchairpunter is 
@ amberlportwood you’ve changed so much in the space of one episode - & way you’re treating that poor andrew guy already is shocking. you’ll end up alone again. thought you’d changed for the better. sorry. calling it as it’s coming across #teenmomog 
@ chiefs …

i might have come along had you not written that awful tweet about corbyn. some historian you turned out to be. 
done that yesterday afternoon. you say cs will get in touch “soon”. what does that mean?? clearly you treat me as importantly as my experience in your restaurant #burgerkinguk #poorservice 
@ mcdonalds seriously? there's over a dozen mcds in my county and none have the mulan sauce. 1 store said they started with only 50 packets. 
@ diljitdosanjh what kinda garbage did you just put out?!! 6 yrs and this is the 9 track trash we get??!!!! 
wow there really won’t be any st patrick’s day #celtics jerseys #nike 
working in #logistics has taught me to be really good at taking #rejection as well as not feeling to bad when ppl tell me they are with me... 
that time when i wrote a nice, articulate, thoughtful response to someone on @ twitter only to accidentally click outside the tweet box and it closes the box. and all my tweet-magic disappears into the ether...

well @ dicks it's been real 
dick's sporting goods, you lost a customer today. one who not only frequents your establishment, but one who coaches and, as such, will not be recommending your services to the over 100 athletes and families that i see throughout the school year. #unamerican @ dicks 
maybe he thought you were going to pick him up and let him live in the house?! 
@ clear how are you not at o’hare?! waiting in line is the worst!

@ realfpjr - new to prinze and the wolf and listening from the beginning. really bummed to hear you bag on stl for cheating in an august (i think) podcast!!! the patriots have the market cornered on cheating and you don’t throw that kind of shade at them!!! 
@ secretarycarson shame on you! i thought you were better than this! … 
@ tmobilehelp @ tmobile @ johnlegere terrible customer service! 
we can only hope. he really is turning his back on a lot of his supporters. going to make 2020 interesting. 
well thanks @ pkshow for letting the minister #paulkeogh away with literally murder #homeless he even got his plug in for #eircode pat, when did you become so pro-establishment ? was it when you moved to @ patkennynt ? although not really surprised sadly. … 
'why is mec waffling?' nra consumer threat takes co-op back to ethical roots all these years of mec shopping i had no idea i was funding the gun movement 
have been in the queue since the beginning this morning and i'm currently 23219. @ kencen posted that only the premium seats are available now. i don't know if they could have done this better, but it seems there are a lot of unhappy members. #hamiltondc 
what absolute nonsense @ twitter! no one wants spam, but surely limiting the accounts can publish from to 2, 3 or even 5 would help. you, @ twittersupport, have removed half of #tweetdeck features on one ‘update’. 
tonight we ordered a @ dominos_uk and went to eat my cookies as marked on the box and bam it’s garlic bread!! instead of 2 boxes of cookies like in the family meal deal we got 2 boxes of garlic bread lol. not really the same is it? #cookies #garlicbread 
movie at cineworld just cut short by a power cut. staff quite unapologetic and bordering on rude. power cuts can’t be controlled . customer service can.

most of the bigger bands for warped tour are only for certain dates. 
so, got an @ sonyxperia xz premium... good phone, great camera... awful sound...

it would’ve been nice to have consideration for belfast city centre staff! lisburn road store closed which isn’t that far from us, along with sprucefield & forestside bearing in mind that staff in the belfast travel from all different areas #amberalert

i cant believe @ bendelacreme sent himself home #allstars3 
just watched #veronica #netflix don’t know why everyone’s calling it the scariest movie no where near but the kids were amazing in it very well acted! 
and you're all standing there smiling??? i'm shocked that you're not giving the "thumbs up" sign like you did in parkland at the hospital. what better place now than a funeral? 
i expected another acl tear 
@ delta been on hold for 38 minutes! left a call back - which i never got. extremely extremely frustrating. the flight i’m rescheduled for is too late, i need an earlier one. please help!!! #skymiles #member #frustrated

@ delta while i appreciate many of the perks that come with diamond status, the four class international upgrades has proven to be a waste. 4th time trying to use one and turned away again. 
hehehehehehe @ vicearabia lame is your new norm 
@ delta been on hold for over 30 minutes. left my number for call back - that never happened #frustrated 
following eager expectation and respect for the director’s previous work, i finally watched #thedeathofstalin . completely underwhelmed. for me the background and growing brutality just couldn’t marry the attempted humour. 
@ united you really are the worst ever #theworst #rude 
guess i didn’t know you as well as i thought i did 
previous years i would eat several boxes of girl scout cookies a week. this year quality and flavor by comparative standards is terrible and haven’t gone through a single box in 10 days. #girlscoutcookies 
@ secretarycarson i am a supporter of yours and actually was hoping you would do well when you ran for president. i found it hard to believe you would do something as irresponsible with my tax $ as a $31,000 piece of furniture. glad you returned it. #buyityourself 
just watched veronica on #netflix and it wasn’t scary at all #notscaryatall 
the weather this next week dropped 
i had the worst flight with @ flyspicejet ... the seat push back buttons didn't work and the hostess was rude too. horrible experience at 2 am in the morning. where's your hospitality? 
@ mbta the 66 route bus is extremely irregular. constantly waiting 20+ minutes for buses to come. 
so @ drivemaven your customer service gives me mixed information, which causes my car to be towed. been trying to sort this for 4 weeks. not a good look #maven 
@ dominos_uk as a strict vegetarian my friends and i are gutted to find ham in my veg pizza and a lack of care from the team at elephant & castle

@ footlocker went 2 my local store to return an online order. was told to go to a diff store because they didn’t have a bag to fit the #kobe box? what’s up with that? #customerservice 
manny and i just sang (yelled) the entire opening song from hamilton to the dog, changing the name to alexander chanchoton and the little bitch didn’t even appreciate it. 
@ costacoffee wasn’t impressed today when i was served half a coconut cappuccino after paying full price because the store had run out of coconut milk, for my only option to be a cappa made with cows milk to make up the difference! #poorservice 
i'm a bit disappointed that i didn't see a #snapchat filter for #blackpanther as someone who uses #snapchat daily and looks forward to seasonal filters. 
why does @ greatestshowman only have 1 oscar nomination? i thought it would wipe the floor over everything!! #theoscars2018 
dwayne... have you waxthe baywatch? i mean wtf man!! that movie was so disjointed and you hyped it so much. 
@ pc_optimum it’s been over a month now that this new program went into effect. i never receive many promos for shoppers- shopped there all the time before- all i get are food promos. this new program has not lived up to expectations 
for the record, he is not. 
veronica on @ netflixuk is a alright film but not 'the scariest ever film' and if people are turning it off half way through it's probably because they can't be arsed reading anymore subtitles. 
@ piefivepizza #piefiveeastbrunswick is this supposed to be an athenian pan crust?? all i said was no kalamata olives. what happened to the crust, feta, sundried tomato puree, and basil?!? 
wow!!! not what you would expect from @ royalcaribbean #seaofthieves 
@ dominos what the heck is this?! when i spoke with the manager i was told, “in life mistakes happen.” that thing is more than a mistake... i don’t know what that is #badservice – bei domino's pizza 
ah! @ philaflowershow so very #disappointed. i get that it’s a huge fundraiser, but people go to see the gorgeous displays, to buy things for our gardens is a bonus, not the point of the show. the concourses could be used to display more of the commercial areas. 
and i still have t heard from anyone to follow up with me. #poorcustomerservice #unhappy how are you going to make this right? 
beautiful weekend in beautiful liverpool until a staff member@lpl_airport insulted and verbally abused me infront of other passengers because @ easyjet had made a simple mistake. #disappointed#complaint#

the only thing i cared about from @ marvel legacy was mark waid on captain america for the first time in 20 years and you’re already taking that away for your 20th reboot this week. #marvelfreshstart 
#oscars wasn't a telethon for equal pay or against sexual advances! but many men, who support women, it became a long series of sermonenttes. the show needed to have been less prosecutorial, and more entertaining. i went to sleep; others may have channel surfed. 
@ harristeeter in clarksburg. lines at 640 pm like there is a snowstorm. what gives? either find some cashiers or i am going elsewhere.

well that’s an hour of my life i’m not going to get back. #actionteam

i’m an idiot for thinking this would be any different from any other time. 
it did not look routine, it does not excuse the physical contact and your officer saying "i don't care" - needs a more professional response 
just ordered a baconator from @ wendys ... waited all day for this and there is no bacon in it! it says it in the name! #shook 
oh man, for a minute i thought that they were going to start selling whoppers. have to stick with @ burgerking

@ garminuk i bought the #vivoactive3 2 weeks ago & my battery is lasting less than 48hrs. is this a fault? is there anything i can do to improve this? my last #vivoactive lasted 4 weeks!!i can’t use it properly due to frequent overnight charging! 
over a month & @ hyundaiindia has still failed to resolve issues that have been escalated to their regional office constantly over the last 2 years. i might be driving a flying car by the time they resolve the issues #truly #customerexperience

@ napaknowhow in columbia didn't have any chase elliott hats today. 
@ medivet_uk i am appalled that a 60 second follow up appointment to tell us eye drops prescribed to my mums dog are working cost £40! absolutely disgraceful! considering the drops cost £50 last week which we can buy in boots for £3.50! @ carolynronald #rippedoff 
so i guess i’m not paying my car off until the end of the month.

so much for the quaker on the oats... @ … 
the fan base were willing to crowd fund a season 3, i feel you have just given up on the show and the fans, i just feel like the fans fought harder than the people that made the show. sorry but you don't deserve this fan base, the show doesn't deserve this either. 
wow right after i leave 
black panther is a racist movie. there were no white superheroes. do they expect me to let my little brice to look up to a bunch of nigg— i mean, a bunch of violent people?

@ pattonoswald one of the problems with completing a book after the author dies is there can be no re-writes. this would have been a far different book had she lived to complete it herself. a good editor would have worked with her to trim out much of the fluff

opening night for #cf97 and we’re already in protest mode. really @ section8chicago? i swear, we must be the most easily offend supporters group in mls. singing voices are louder than poorly created banners. #disappointed. 
you didn’t even take this opportunity to say “breast back breaking life” … 
tried something new, bought one of my textbooks on kindle via @ amazonkindle. $90 later- because even ebooks for school are obnoxiously priced- and amazon says that the book is unsupported on my kindle. i guess i’ll read it on my phone screen. 
my goodness, did trump really have to tweet such an intriguing story just to leave us all on a cliffhanger? … 
i definitely feel like @ publix should have taken a customer poll before they just removed their fresh homemade cornbread out of the stores and replaced it with prepackaged cornbread 
@ firehousesubs first time patrons: long wait time (no biggie) no dill pickles and my fiance sub was loaded with ham instead of double turkey. love the #subs but the service was not a good first impression at all.

the average transaction @ bestbuy takes way too long. fortunately i will no longer be shopping there once they quit stocking compact discs. used to be a great store & experience.

@ whitecastle last time we were in, we didn’t get our zesty sauce. this time we didn’t get an order of onion chips and they were out of zesty sauce. i want to come back, but if store 050025 can’t get an order right, i don’t see the point. #onionchipsmissing

@ youtube 
i really think this is unprofessional for you snow monster staff to argue with a negative tweet. i think a lot of channel 30 but this is very wrong. i’m surprised that no one has stopped this. it happened during the last storm too.

been a huge jags fan for 20+ years now and as big of a supporter as i am i'm also capable of criticism and a dash of realism and this offeseason hasn't been approached or executed in a manner befitting of a team on the cusp of a superbowl. #duuuval 
@ nfhsnetwork can’t see the game i want to see. why is the boradcast delayed?! 
@ tmobile @ tmobilehelp how does the verizon s8 get oreo before t-mobile s8? verizon wasn't even in the beta. thought you guys prided yourselves in being ahead of the others? 
@ boyscouts i ordered popcorn from a boy that came to my door and i paid for it but never received it. 
@ uohelpme ordered a medium wool blazer and this is what i ended up with.. the size was 18w. how did this even get shipped out? 18w is plus size not medium, and the utter wrinkling of the material is not okay. 
this is both insulting & disrespectful! canada is one of usa's largest & most strategic trading partners; by doing so @ potus dimishes the office of the presidency #wordsmatter #truthmatters 
it’s kind of a shame that i literally woke up the second @ fortnitegame put up the fortnite mobile sign ups and signed up at 9am before servers went down for maintenance and i haven’t even gotten a fortnite mobile invite code... :( @ epicgames 
sorry, jeremy. i was with you all the way until this - but you are now pre-judging this. russia does not have to be held to account if it was not guilty. there remain many other possibilities. your statesmanlike approach has slipped. 
@ tsn_sports @ tsngo your live steaming is normally spot on - but your “bonus coverage” feeds do not work on 4 devices now - ipad, iphone, windows app, windows browser.

and, i was always taught if you have nothing nice to say you simply don’t say anything. all this hate and evil being spread through a community i was once happy and proud to be a part of has to stop or it will end us all for good. needless to say 
#veronica was actually kinda... meh.. i've seen worse. like my last electricity bill. that shit was horrifying.

i’m not a juve fan, i’m a barca fan. and i want napoli to win the league. but today was not the day to draw. me and my friend @ wilmertorin was right on the four bpl matches and valencia -alaves. our bet was on fire. we only needed a win for juve. but no.

same plane and same carry on, yet on way back @ aeroflot @ aeroflot_world out right robs you by not allowing that same carry on and charging 100 euros to check it in #flying will not use again! @ turkishairlines you are 10x better 
i thought for a moment the economist was finally covering music not featured on radio three but #markesmith wasn't actually the subject #sirhumphreyappelby 
@ drtomcampbell @ 1440mv i've lived in #santacruz since 1987 & worked as a non-profit admin. assist., & writer. 1440 doesn't offer affordable workshops to locals not earning silicon valley-sized paychecks. 1440 classes would benefit from inclusivity, not exclusivity. … 
i live 15 min. from 1440 & i'd love to attend—it would be a dream come true. i can't afford the fee. nearby esalen offers scholarships but not 1440. it seems like 1440 is geared to those who have lots of money; not to most locals/middle-class moms. 
@ big_bella we're usually big fans but what a shame your #walsall venue ruined my son's birthday on sunday with appalling service and massive delays on food. probably the first time a restaurant has been so bad we've walked out! #poorshow

@ sentomcotton @ johnboozman we are looking for you to take a stand and #voteno on the #omnibus - what happened to regular order? what happened to controlling our spending? what happened to border security? @ realdonaldtrump @ senatemajldr 
@ gooseisland why can’t your staff at #o'hare make their own choices for tv/music..it’s #ncaatournament and we can’t watch #fail 
will we be told the reason after it's investigated? probably not... we were told it was due to crew being delayed... so was this a lie? #delayrepay will be used a lot tonight, loads of unhappy commuters (again) at victoria... #southern #delaysdelaysdelays

went to my neighbourhood @ safewaycanada yesterday to buy a flyer sale item. out of stock. asked for raincheck. was told i could only get 6 of the item per raincheck per customer. flyer says limit of 15. asked for 2 rainchecks. answer is still no. #customerservice 
after a promising first period it turned out to be a disappointing final home game of a poor season for @ braeheadclan on the plus side awesome convo about all things clan in the carpark with @ 123emmab @ sirbenmoore and a guy they know after the game! #endofseason 
but you forgot do a double face in the thumbnail because of gemini 
you are right maureen, he has a been a massive disappointment .. can't do 'empathy' and that grates with regular punters .. his staged empathy photo-ops reek of ego not the reality of what is confronting him. selfies with cher won't help his need for approval 
@ marthamaccallum seriously? why an entire segment, and all this hype for the #chappaquiddick movie? the murder of a young woman by someone who should have died in prison. kennedy's were as corrupt as the clintons, why are you promoting this clearly slanted story? 
@ hollisterco first i was sent the wrong shorts, then i realized the tag on them was ripped, then realized i had no return label sent to me. 
sad to see that @ elizabethmay has lowered herself to this. obviously she doesn’t have the skills needed to bring real change as a political leader! i’m … 
@ potus with all due respect, 2232 page bill signed that no one read...really? we ripped the dems for that. pp gets $$ to continue murdering babies, not one cent for the wall.really? broken promises, pres trump. 
this issue is being debated and discussed, she was elected to bring change in the government on our behalf. by protesting in this manner it looks like she no longer has the skills to complete this task. @ elizabethmay 
u gave up ur presidency today sir sorry to say. u r right u won’t coz u won’t be there for the next one. stop making excuses & stop dreaming u r not getting line-item veto. that’s not happening

@ realdonaldtrump i really think you sealed your fate for 2020 because you signed that bill. it was an obama move. big mistake. #disappointed, #youcaved, #youjoinedtheswamp 
security is one thing but blindly blocking people with no way to immediately fix blocking errors is inefficient at best and lazy at worst. i would expect more from a sophisticated technological platform like fb.

so, the 'leadership group' met, cheating emerged and was sanctioned as a calculated course of action, then implemented. a dark day for #cricket and for @ cricketaus. at least they owned up. but smith must resign as skipper. @ scottsowales @ sidthebody

either the team has been taking the public for mugs, or we, the public, have been naïve assuming that our elite players were representing us with the highest standards of sportsmanship and fair play. or both. i am very #disappointed. #notcricket

#nobleigwe me – #bigbrothernaija’s …

only in america will adults ridicule and criticize younger citizens who are actually doing something with their lives and demanding change

@ toysrus i ordered a cozy coupe for my kiddo instead of making her an easter basket and now i’m out $55 because i can’t cancel my order even though it won’t arrive in the previously specified timeframe. guess i’m going last minute easter basket shopping. 
i wish i knew. they start shipping mid-year. the kit they sent was just a demo. 
i called the rspca, the lady was not helpful, unsympathetic and said if we didn’t have the trap and hadn’t seen it happen, there was nothing they could do. i told her i just wanted it reported so no other animals got hurt. she said it was logged. i hung up! 
what's a curly haired woman to do #aremoji 
i'm really disappointed in g&g's steaks in #gonzalestexas we went there earlier and no one was up front to greet. stood there and employees were walking around and looked up at us but no said anything. with no service we had to leave. not going back again. 
really disappointed by the extremely large price increase to rent a truck from @ penskemoving over the past year! a 25% increase in a single calendar year for no legitimate reason! strongly considering using @ budgetrentalllb this time rather than penske! #expensive

my review of @ chickfila's new premium southwest salad w/ creamy salsa dressing: bland, too much romaine, oversized side salad, visually unappealing. it needs chili lime vinaigrette & more spring mix, carrots, red cabbage sprinkled evenly on top. #foodiwouldnteat

@ bwwings please please please bring back the spinach artichoke flatbread!!!!

@ anthonyfjoshua such a disappointment! u could have knocked him out! poor fight 
fuck! it is too real right now. i'm sitting here in tears, realizing that maybe this just will not work out. how do i fucking learn to not let people close enough to keep hurting and disappointing me? #sad … 
you've always been controversial, so i'm not going to turn around and expect different from u now, but this is one time we won't laugh later about what you believed in or said or supported. he's not any old guy anymore, even you should realize that. #roseannebarr

saw on facebook that #trump fired #pence as vp. spent several minutes looking for sources before i saw the comments and realized. #aprilfoolsday 
i don't think that his broad criticism of vegans is warranted. criticize the individuals but not the choices of those not implicated in the incident. that our checkoff dollars are used to support the blind ideology. 
back from a long break from twitter. when did it become another advertising forum? #canijustgrowmybrainplease #notheretoo #thisiswhywedonthavetelevision 
@ bluejays love my jays but am upset that they get a cut from tickets resold by 3rd parties eg stubhub. until their support for this is changed, i will never buy another ticket nor licensed product. my protest makes little impact but it’s the principle. #emptyseats?

it's been more than a week since my first complaint and i have lodged 3-4 complaints overall. however @ olacabs sydney, doesn't bother to call back and update anything about those complaints. pathetic customer support #pathetic 
@ mathis_brothers letting a widow down for the second time in three days? #badservice #wheresmyfurniture 
just as i figured, typical of #hasbro #combiners, #volcanicus doesn't tab together well and the areas around the foot & fist ports separate easily. not sure if bad tolerances or cheap plastic or both. 
@ cubs should be embarrassed at the start to this season after mlb teed them up to start out 7-0. are the @ whitesox going to be the better team this year? #cubs 
i will say that i'm pretty disappointed. i had no clue you would raise the checked bag fee for adding my bag at a later time that was still multiple days away from my flight. next time i will go with another airline. #frontier #baggagefees 
i'm nothing if not efficient. i'm disappointed though. surely a #slut with your talent could have thought of an alternative for aforementioned customs guard. done properly, he( she?) could've been my new #paypig. you've let me down. 
hey @ weareroli why send me and show me advertising for a product that i can’t purchase in store anywhere. been to three places and i was hoping to get the songmaker kit and haven’t found it. you sent your email prematurely. i cant get the software upgrade now 
@ asda @ asdaserviceteam still no delivery after 1 hr. couldn't rearrange delivery 4 2moro so i give up. no food in the house & will have 2 order from tesco who cost more and don't have everything i want. how about compensating me for time and inconvenience? #nofood 
shocked that the show has stooped to this level! this is no fun to watch hope you sack the person that thought this one up

@ redletterdaysuk any feedback on the cancelled beatles evening tour on monday? @ burnagema and @ lucieburnage would have appreciated being told of the cancellation - would have saved them a trip..... 
that moment when @ leslieodomjr was promoting his new book in your campus and you didn't know 
heres the study for those following along at home … that the proud @ uofcalifornia and @ calstate systems did not participate but shout out to san diego ccs for showing up. the first step to fixing the problem is admitting that you have one!!! 
when you expect to actually get #icecream with a banana split. thanks @ dairyqueen #thatsanexpensivebanana 
@ drewlachey @ nicklachey @ justinjeffre @ jefftimmons … can we talk about how you just toured with @ dreamgirlgroup and now you're just fine with doing a show with @ backstreetboys? not supporting that crap. not even after 20 years of love. 
terrible service from swoon, no delivery of product, no information, no call as promised and no armchair! after paying hundreds of pounds. where is my money? where is my chair? how will you fix?!!! #badservice #disgusting

really disappointed with how @ thensls at @ wpunj_edu is handling the new round of members trying to get inducted. poor communication and terrible people skills 
i have reached out to @ jakeellzey as a potential constituent in a reasonable fashion regarding issues important to agriculture, energy and national security. his or a campaign staffer's response has been less than adequate. in you sir! 
got a cotton candy @ dairyqueen blizzard the other day that was nothing more than soft serve mixed with sprinkles. 
agreed.......the only thing i enjoyed was @ deltagoodrem and im a sucker for an opening ceremony

@ mlb i live in nc and cannot watch the yankees/baltimore game! #blackoutsucks #fanslose #justwanttowatchbaseball 
dear @ mlbnetwork can you please explain how the cardinals/diamondbacks game is being shown in the western ny area when the cities of both cincinnati and pittsburgh are closer to this market than st. louis and phoenix. do you need a map? #annoyed #youfail 
ouch! i've read some quotes on the london underground, genuinely thought they were a parody for an upcoming comedy show... 
too bad i can't log in to my account.. got a new phone and apparently logging in with facebook doesn't save your info … 
another delayed flight with @ tuiuk surprise surprise! #delays #tui @ tuigroup @ tuiukcares 
@ chefsymon no incredible burger at the q?? where's the vegan love??? 
what happened to my daily tweets? 
i wish i thought it was possible - nothing else i've offered to do for the last 2 years has been accepted. … 
i’ve been in chicago for 8ish hours and there’s been no signs of kaner, keith, or toews 
@ bbcwatchdog @ easyjet rejected my appeal (twice) against a €60 fee gate fee for an additional item of luggage. i showed them this screenshot from their app which i based my booking a seat. no asterisks or exclusion clauses noted on screen. 
really wish @ lowes could have helped me with this return (like the one manager promised). their plastic sheds don’t do well with wind. 
why conor, why??? #conormcgregor #ufc … 
@ commgamesaus swimming organisers! move the presentation podium so the 5000 people in the western stand can also see it. #notthinking #fixitnow 
@ firstdates why did you get rid of the afterwards bit to see if they continue dating!? #firstdates 
toodles @ thenotoriousmma .. you’ve spent years trying to prove yourself and succeeded, encouraging fans to support you ... you’ve just ruined it all.... 
@ premierinn this is the worst premier inn i’ve stayed in for noise and it’s all new. i could join in with the conversation from the next door room and they’re not even being loud. no sound proofing = no good nights kip #promisedsomuch – bei premier inn 
smh!! conor what were you thinking??? … 
not surprised....just .... this is why people build walls...every time you trust someone new...they end up reminding you why you shouldn't trust anyone at all. 
@ starbuckscanada why didn’t i get my birthday reward?? #goldmember 
i heard about this the other day. free classroom tech resources are awesome! expensive subscriptions are not. #padlet @ … 
damn that's still florida lol 
today i learned - makers mark is not nearly as smooth as crown 
17kgs down and no one from #liteneasy or #jennycraig has contacted me.... 
from a shoddy make up job at @ ultabeauty to the general manager at @ columbia1905 telling a group of 16 teens that they didn’t call in a reservation which they certainly did- it was a day of disappointments. customer service is dead. #prom 
shame on you @ safeway. closing the store in bryans road, md, leaving us with only food lion because you weren't making enough money? i won't be driving to your stores 20 minutes away, so you've lost my business. #disappointed, #safeway 
#requiem started off so well. got sillier, and ever more bizarrely confusing with each episode. the final one left me feeling i will never get those sixty minutes of my life back again - and very angry! 
@ cinnabon at perimeter mall, atlanta ga. very in the food court location today. i always go there to but a glass of milk, but today they said they had run out. when i can see the gallon from where i was standing. one employee stopped the other from serving it 
this smartfood caramel and cheddar mix is nasty. i don’t know what they hype was about. 
strange how quickly the shoe shifts to the other foot. railed and ranted against ceec's blindness to her faults only to realize how much worse it is with tobi. #bbnaija 
this is ridiculous … 
@ globalnewsto @ globalnational this evening’s news broadcast re #firsttime interview with kathleen wynne was not appropriate. interview the man/woman on the street. wynne’s was definitely looking for votes. 
nice example of sportsmanship. now you've cost a fighter his match because of your behavior resulting in his injury. not becoming of a champion. obviously your in the sport for the money, not the respect. your legacy is now tainted. 
#nachofries from @ tacobell ?? 
i couldn’t agree more! people are raving about it and it’s mediocre. it’s not an impossible princess, a fever, an aphrodite or even a kiss me once! #underwhelmed #sadforkylie 
same! got excited that all the red headed politicians had got together to form a social group. 
i was so excited to get a @ byashleystewart gift card for my birthday because i love their clothes then boom you can't use giftcards online! #sosad 
wtf @ pizzahut that new icing for the cinnamon sticks is absolutely disgusting. i threw them out after 1 bite and now i'm very upset and might never return 
you did it again @ tgifridays @ oxfordvalleypa 
second time in a row @ rockbottom with no “mug club” for members. – bei rock bottom brewery 
not hiring a woman because she’s “too attractive” is also a form of abuse of power, and just sad. i’ve been to @ tonyrobbins events before + respect him, but wow, protecting men who operate out of fear is the opposite of how he used to teach. #losttouch #equalitynow 
i didn't make it in to @ criticalrole panel @ c2e2. #heartbroken apparently people have been in line since 11am. just saw an amazing jester cry because she didn't get in. cr is huge. put them in the main theater tomorrow. i just have to look forward to next year. 
@ mike_anthony13 you could have just said no... #oneminute 
not sure about the legitimacy of votes at #onespark this weekend. they didn't even require verification of email or phone number when registering to vote. and, some creators were offering samples and discounts in exchange for votes. #notcool 
@ nxcare @ nationalexpress poor customer service received yesterday from heathrow national express service desk and 201 driver. 
read this in a couple hours this afternoon. remembered why i stopped reading. if you can blow through 400 pages in a couple hours why spend the $5? #bland #boring 
been so busy at work to the point i don't get to eat. & the only time i have been able to is when i get off work. if i don't eat when i'm actually hungry i lose my appetite and hunger. sooo... one meal a day. that resulted in a 9 pound loss in a matter of 1week... 
yea that's the type of vulgarity that will ban you my house! btw, @ seanhannity your showing of his tapes almost got you banned last night! please don't bring yourself down to his level by showing! discussing about it is one thing but.................. …

dear @ moesjax you've just lost a life long customer over a taco . maybe i'm being petty, but what i just paid for 1 taco is absolutely ridiculous. #notworthit #moessouthwestgrill #shouldhavegonetochipotle @ moes_hq 
why does every other carrier who has the @ essential phone already have the oreo update and i'm still waiting for @ sprint to release it to us. why do we have to be behind the pack. 
@ olacabs they were not following the policy. they told me to pay some extra amount thn the ola app displaying in advance thn only they drop me at my location without starting the ride and told me after drop will cancel the ride. 
#wrestlemania 
unfortunately, the convenience of streaming services such as @ netflixanz and @ stanaustralia are rendered superfluous when your 3 yo @ samsungtv cant maintain a wireless connection to your router located 10 metres away for longer than a minute #wifi #useless

was kinda hoping mean gene would reprise his role of anthem singer. #wrestlemania34 #meangene #tootiefruity 
no introduction (walk-in) handshakes. no off camera jim nance. no camera shot of reed while jim nance talked about him. i think they have been reading junior's tweets about awkwardness..

visit to hmp lancaster castle today, not a pendle witch vibe to be felt! not even in the 17thc prison cell with the door shut & the lights turned off 
though i do wish people would stop talking during the show! this was the first show i had to experienced this such disrespect of the band, musicians and other fans. what’s worse it was (what appeared to be) actual fans of the band!

@ arya_offl proved that men still have upper hand in relationship and he is not as open minded as he says...why was his mom missing? he gave ab such a hard time when her dad and sis werent there. he doesnt want to take random girls to his mom. #engaveetumapillai 
these people be desperate to ruin someone's life

watched original #frightnight. awesome vampire that turned into a whiny little snowflake. 
seeing george & bertie & an audience of young people piqued my interest in watching #nolan tonight. i thought we might have seen some constructive #nipolitics developments. i was for the 2nd time today. (1st was seeing the #westtyrone candidates list this morning)

markifel wore my sweats and hoodie today after school and took them both home. 
unimpressed with leader @ thejagmeetsingh response to the bc-ab pipeline dispute. it’s federal jurisdiction, no court is needed to resolve that. you’ve set yourself up to flip-flop later, mr. singh. #ndp 
@ siriusxmfantasy @ craigmish @ jimbowdengm i listened all week and never heard a single dr. bowden. 
the @ moviepass app should tell you that a movie is dolby and not fully covered by the card before you pay for an uber and are checking out at the kiosk in the theater and unable to choose differently. #toogoodtobetrue 
this has been my least fav season ever of @ antmvh1 . they’ve sent the wrong people home, kept the wrong people, made awful decisions. i’m just extremely disappointed. @ iamkhrystyana should have won. i’m so #antm24 @ tyrabanks #worstseason 
tonight @ exeterlivingawd slightly shocked at the judging process!! anyway a great night! well done 
@ realtristan13 i was rooting for you.. we were all rooting for you 
@ apriestoea, you failed our teachers and students by ending this walkout. there are a lot teachers who aren't a part of the oea. those teachers wanted the walkout to continue because they wanted their kids to have a better education. 
@ apriestoea, you fell short on our teachers and students because you decided to end the walkout. there are a lot of teachers who aren't a part of the oea. those teachers wanted the walkout to continue because they wanted their kids to have a better education.

@ easyjet it would be nice if you didn't ignore peoples tweets, my boyfriend @ lewissv198 tweeted you last week and still not had a reply.... 
getting used to @ trilliumpartyon being ignored by big media, but when media source claiming to be independent completely ignores local candidate's press release in favour of big 3 party, there's something wrong. @ cobourgmedia, independent should also mean impartial. 
understand that the @ trutvjokers have to be safe on their way to okc but we have puppies we have to get home to. can’t leave our pups for three hours longer for you to get to okc!

abc has characterized primaries as "are soaking up the party’s time and money" a subtle way to suggest that party candidates should be appointed by party leadership and that party members opinions are a waste of time. … 
i almost got through friday the 13th without anything bad happening. then i got this sandwich . it’s only missing the tomato, lettuce, bacon, cheese, and avacado!!! it looked like it was going to be so delicious too! @

@ starbucks you mean you apologize for the blatant racism that one of your employees displayed?? like let’s call a duck a duck... smdh #aintgoingback #notmydollars 
at a gay bar. they’re showing videos and playing songs from grease. no grease 2 love. 
out of order! some of us life long fans, who genuinely care about you, luv your music & have contributed to your wealth, actually have a faith. you may mock, be assured it is no fairytale! you have a platform to promote love & inclusivity - not be devisive & mock!!

@ olivegarden ...cannoli trio? try cannoli trino... cold & soggy... i can buy better cannoli from my local grocer for half the price. 
my wife rented a redbox game( mario + rabbids for the switch) someone stole it and took the time to make a fake piece of paper with a number barcode. if you are doing this you are a piece of shit. #redbox 
last year with @ southwestair my flight was delayed, canceled and rescheduled. got a voucher. cool. expires at the end of the month (2018) went to use yesterday. & guess what. it was cancelled. so thanks??? guess you got out of making it up 
really starbucks? this is the best response you can give? just shameful. not sure what’s more appalling the fact that they were arrested or your half assed apology. 
absolutely right. unfortunately, the war hawks are pulling the strings. it’s iraq nukes all over again. two presidents in a row that lied to get into office about getting out of the middle east.

i have hulu, not a single game has been streamed live or post completion #hulu #nhlplayoffs 
#nats seeing a lot of mistakes a veteran manager wouldn't make. wrong positioning, un-disiplined pitching from the bull pen. should have reconsidered dusty. 
@ delta had our party of 6 traveling together now split on two different flights to hawaii. our compensation for their mistake was a lousy $150 voucher per person to be used on another delta vaction trip. not a satisfying compensation for a $10,000 trip using delta. 
it's 2018 and i'm still not a trap queen... 
in @ tacojohns - when did you change from corn tortillas for the street

@ bwwings since when did extra crispy and wet mean under cooked and dry. i guess it’s back to @ wingstop #gross 
being an adult can be very disappointing #adultingishard #disappointed… 
i don't think the loss of life is ever a basis for a joke, and we do remember the halifax explosion every year in nova scotia especially. … 
i was waiting for the man to jump on that too. 
that moment when you’re on hold with insurance and waiting for the bass to drop , on the holding music 
not to mention, when i said i was just curious about price range, i was told "if you have to ask, you probably can't afford it." wow. maybe i can't afford it today but a girl can save up to treat herself, no? #rudeattitude 
@ ifc why does your app only have the last two episodes of s1 of #brockmire? i really wanted to rewatch all of s1 before the new season starts next week. 
i thought he was referring to trump. lol you're right, obama should be referenced racially. but neither should trump be referenced by skin color. racist. count the number of times even in this post you read "orange". thought liberals were past this. #hypocrites 
was excited to hear @ kiaaustralia is bringing out the picanto gt. but the excitement soon disappeared when i heard it will have to same 1.2l and 4 speed auto the normal picanto has and not the turbo 3cyl the europeans get. 
@ united ua 1640 another instance of no pre-departure beverage being offered. #makethisright 
driving to the hotel hungry after not receiving service @ thehickorytav in columbia after being seated. waitstaff all around assisting tables but not mine. #hatebadservice #managernotconcerned 
what i thought was a fig leaf, was really a band-aid; an apparent panacea, actually the apocalypse. 
ordinarily i don’t care about #presidenttrump or #politics because i am in disbelief fear most of the . i really think you should rethink not attending #theformerfirstlady’sfurneral. you hurt my but embarrass yet again. damn shame. 
ever been so mad that you forget how to abuse?! just called someone an ass bag. i’m both #bemused and in my ability to cuss 
i don't get why @ marvelstudios realesed that damn clip! the #blackorder are weak and miserable! this is like an anti ad!! now i am worried about the movie... and i have a feeling i will hate it... how can black widow and cap stand a chance against the black order. 
@ muchoburritohq - seriously? there’s barely any #pulledpork on this burrito! is this seriously what your food is supposed to look like? 
think it will be awhile before i come back to @ taylorgourmet - they’ve drastically reduced their menu and no longer have roast pork or meatball sandwiches. yet supposed to be #philly inspired?? #limitedmenu 
just waiting for the many «calzona are endgame» tweets i know will be coming in a short while #mad #annoyed 
@ nike...was super excited about my free rn t-shirts... until i put them on ... 
you should start posting your fitness progress pics. no one will pay extra to for an mls channel even to see your mug (other than mental institutions). especially when the pod is free . #capitalism 
sometimes, you just need a childhood favorite after a long day. but apparently @ starbucks is too good to make italian sodas anymore. really, guys? really? you can’t just throw soda, cream and a flavor together in a cup? 
ok not just half baked product . it has lot of half baked scenes in it. surprised to see my twitter feed #bharatanenenu 
team @ tmwpay sahi hai.... both winner did not eligible for contest.।। & you make them winner this is never expected from you clear cut cheating by you.... hum pagal hai jo tweets krte hai... aur ye dono bina tweet kiye jeet gye...

@ ups i got home 5 minutes ago, ran up stairs to change and headed out the door again. when i went to leave, there was a notice that i missed my package. it wasn’t there there when i got home 5 minutes ago. no one knocked or anything, because i would have heard it 
@ aerlingus i am a proud customer of your airline but am extremely disappointed in how you treated my sister and her family this evening leaving her stranded in lanzarote airport with no support and 2 young children. very disappointing #notimpressed 
@ mcalistersdeli how you gonna leave the pickle out just because i got my food to go. #bestpart 
i lost respect for dershowitz. he is creating chaos for personal gain.

@ royallondon if i am getting zero % interest on the annual bonus, how is this a “with profits policy”? it’s been zero % interest for years. 
garbage @ uber_support increasing their booking fee again. keep pocketing more and more money while u screw your drivers over and over again. 
i had no idea the @ medium api was so underdeveloped. can't even get a list of stories from a publication. 
so not satisfied with that @ scandalabc finale. shonda you could have done better 
come on chipotle...no lettuce! hardly looks like got anything. #chipolte 
why is it that @ amazonca can never deliver me a game day one like they say they can? #godofwarday 
@ papaginos next time i order your cinnamon sticks, would you please do me the courtesy of cooking them before they are delivered? hope my 4 year old doesn’t get sick from eating one before i realized it 
46 for me at some choices 
hey #deltaairlines - with that “plane downgrade” you decided to stick me in a middle seat when i booked an aisle, and the cherry on top, made me check my carry-on bag. downgrading you now. #flight234 
dumb move. makes dems look weak. need to speak to, and do something for, the undecideds and the people that #cheeto isn’t helping. bush league strategy! and i really, really want the dems to take the house and senate to stop the facists and their enablers. 
such generic response. #privilegebanking #icicibank please escalate this @ icicibank @ icicibank_care 
@ hbgbeerweek @ wickedweedbeer how come there were only 24 glasses for giveaway at al’s pizza in dillsburg? i @ wickedweedbeer and was looking forward to adding a glass to my collection they are out at 6:30 
@ dodge this is a pretty poor design. whenever it rains it fills right up. runs down the hatch, and into the light somewhere in the gap between the light and the door. 
this should be the day #nationalprisaa2018 #badminton

@ hardrockstadium what’s up with no big screens at the buffett concert? 
it bothers me that when the @ stjohnsedge were playing in london i could use chrome cast but now they are back home i can't. #goedgego 
just saw the #seasonfinale of @ scandalabc and while i do respect all the hard work that the @ scandalwriters, @ shondarhimes and cast put into the series, and while i have enjoyed it entirely as a whole, the finale was poor, anti-climactic, and full of holes. 
why doesn't wal-mart play the yodeling wal-mart boy on the loudspeaker 
not feeling the love with @ peiburgerlove this year. too many burgers precooked to serve faster but are very dry

#shameful #notcanadianvalues #apologynotauthentic.. 
@ ray_ban why are your incredibly expensive sunglasses disintegrating on me? last year the other arm fell apart too. faulty batch?

there was no joke last night. 
ew shania twain … 
hey @ asicsamerica these shoes are less than 6 months old. not good quality. 
how many pieces in @ kfc_uki_help chicken share? according to #h781001 in dunnellon, just 4. and they don't answer their phone either. 
sure, no candidate controls who votes for them, but candidates do control how they react to endorsements, particularly from political opponents. surprised to see you lap up the ukip best wishes, especially given their local islamophobic campaigning. 
she's clearly an idiot. #girlbye 
there are zero skulls or zombie hands coming up from those flowers. 
. @ cnn how can you allow such a racist, bigot like rep peter king spread such blatant lies on live tv? this dude is nuts. free speech may be guaranteed but no one should have to listen to this nonsense. i'm very in you. 
thank you, audible, for getting me all excited to see a 2-for-1 sale, only to find out it's only for the classic books i read in high school and college. 
justin trudeau called & agrees with me... he wants your canadian citizen card back

@ flipkart seems you've already given up on your customers and your services, even before being "purchased" by @ walmart. this is not a great end of the 'so called' best ecommerce company of india. #patheticservice

sure am disappointed that the @ diamondheels game was rained out today! had my heart set on watching the heels on tv! #goheels #carolinagirl #diamondheels 
just saw the movie: a quiet place. i was not impressed. was a 3rd rate rip-off of signs - 2002 movie. that mel gibson movies had a far more interesting/entertaining story than this one. :( 
is this life now finding out shows are canceled on social media?! #thepath 
been 2 hrs and there's no reply from @ walmart. how is this suppose to help solve my issue with the products i purchased. #evenmore #ignore 
cmon @ chickfila you are better than this....... my 12 count came with a little extra crunch today... #notcool 
just went to my favorite pho place (not going to say which one) and i found hair in my egg rolls and pho soup! i mean could have been an isolated incident because we’ve never had issues before but it literally left a bad taste in my mouth.... 
it was light bean chili but i'll make up for it with beer later #probably

ugh fuck it then, i already know its gonna suck 
@ tim_cook you are going to meet with trump. i’m very disappointed in your pandering to him. i used to be a staunch apple supporter but because of your support for trump and his horrible administration i am spending my money elsewhere 
still not working for me either. i got my code when i bought my xbox one x. 
@ kanyewest you and this trump thing makes me not want to buy your album when it comes out. you’re lucky it’s with cudi or else i wouldn’t give it a second thought. smh 
@ fcbayernus @ miamimunchen did @ lewy_official play today??? has anybody seen him??? i have yet to see him perform well in a big game... #miasanmia #packmas #fcbrma

@ proteinhouse1 got ph salad with extra steak, 3 brownies to reward my kids. $45 dollars!!! are you kidding me?!?!?!. consider this the first and last time i will step foot in here. 
whoa, @ esri! “sierra nevada ‘mountains’”? you should know better than that! 
so bummed @ kohls that my online order arrived with the security tag on it!!! i ordered online so i wouldn’t have to go into the store!!!! guess i won’t be wearing these jeans tonight.

nothing ever go as planned 
@ marvelstrikef got response from your support that you cannot delete/reset my account.. that’s not acceptable i want to be the boss of my data. if i want to play from scratch i should be able to do that. #angry 
when your so close but yet very far now ... 
jessica is converting to christianity... #disowned 
yes you did ari, but you shouldn’t have. creativity and individuality don’t have a thing to do with shouldering the platform of a blatant racist. it’s offense to many and hurtful to black people. 
dear @ meghanmccain i adore your family - always loved your dad and actually voted for him in 2008 but lately on @ theview your just always on the defense and yes @ joyvbehar is right u have no sense of humor 
when you are looking forward to some @ arbys but the fries are old, and your “no mayo” sandwich is slathered in it #ihatemayo @ arbyscares but don’t worry, they said i can drive all the way back to get new 
kanye only loves himself, do you even read the news ari? the "wheelchair incident" at one of his concerts... taylor swift... the "i'm a genius" rhetoric. south park captured his true essence. @ arimelber stop giving that histrionic fool attention. 
had a dream i was in paris last night, woke up in england #shocked #hurt 
not close in size, color, or number of flowers. yet @ teleflora still charged me the "premium" price. 
we the people are #disappointed. please level with us @ realdonaldtrump afraid at this late date “...there will be blood in the street...” as rfk is quoted as saying? trump keeps some jfk documents sealed until 2021 as archives release final … 
so @ thesimonevans is on qt and he didn't do the 'two things you'll notice about me' joke. 
seriously, what the hell. just talk to me ffs. #vaguetweet 
#drsmith is annoying at hell in @ lostinspacetv. she just seems to be bad or disruptive for no apparent reason at all... no agenda, nothing to gain. the script, story line and acting are just really poor quality. who wrote this crap? 
shame on you #altonbrown #buffalo has the best wings around. i'm not even from here and i know better. fan. 
i really want to like #lostinspace on @ netflix... but it's a bit shit 
we just need to play our life at the next round #afcvatl #arsenal 
@ duracell you only gave me two days of juice on my controller now im switch to @ energizer and see if they can do better 
@ wendys i can’t not understand why your employees can not get my order right ever. you guys are one of the worst fast food restaurants ever. #worstcompanyever #horrible 
if only @ mesutozil1088 would use the same spirit and energy when we are in a deficit. he waits when we are losing then starts getting frustrated...can't he play to become the best in every game.

@ timhortons i'm so disappointed right now. for the past week now, your coffee has been tasting old and bitter. don't get me wrong, i love your coffee! but this has been happening to frequently. #stilldrinkittho 
this stems from your childhood. you probably eat fake turkey bacon 
i was doing the wingardium leviosa and my energy was over, i just wanted to be able to play more than 5 minutes, #disappointed, 
me after #infinitywar 
imho your "support" for kanye hurt your legacy and didn't do anything to "help" him. now people are using your tweets in ads -- making $$$ of the words (literally) of blacks. and against 1 of our own -- obama. as a felliow proud chicagoan i'm truly ashamed ... 
i was doing the wingardium leviosa and my energy was over, i just wanted to be able to play more than 5 minutes, #harrypotterhogwartsmystery #helpjkrowling@portkeygames @harrypotterhogwartsmystery @ jamcityhq @ hpana @ wbhomeent @ jk_rowling @ harrypotterfilm help

this situation is eerily similar to what we have had to listen to on the cfac committee for @ highlineschools #notquitethesame … 
#avengerinfinitywar 
@ kanyewest there is being a free thinker and then there is being ridiculous. sorry pal...you’ve seriously gone over the edge. you can’t actually care about your children’s future while supporting a racist, sexist, bigot of a president. #wtf 
@ olivercallan jaysus callan... great show this evening have we to wait till autumn 
the american girl keti had always wanted to decorate her own room. she invited the american #artist giorgi and hoped that he could paint his favorite animal, the cat, on the wall ...

@ yoplait i usually love your flavors of yogurt, but i found the key lime crunch to be very unpleasant! it tasted like some kind of cleaning agent. it was horrible. never tasted any lime flavor like that. #moneywasted #fail 
shame it wasn't a vintage tigers performance.....oh well there's always next season. #tigersfamily 
i thought it was a decent stand-alone movie. but it should've been called something different, given it had nothing to do with the game except the title. 
@ emiratessupport with the response to my query to help make my daughter's honeymoon extra special. the suggestion that i buy them a cake was laughable. #poorservice 
the crowd today at fenway sucks at the wave. cmon people

@ kickstarter as much as i enjoy backing creators on your platform. it is disappointing to note that three creators of projects i have backed seemingly refuse to communicate with backers about delivery updates. feeling like some are now scams. 
a nigga went rounds last night/this morning and didn’t even use @rjgunnermusic and i’s rounds mix smh 
been waiting 20 minutes on the phone to speak with someone from @ nespressoca. is this rly the customer service you guys are going for ? cuz it sucks. 
tanya paid a big price for her actions. this is acting like a leftist bully. it's an entertainment dancing show/competition. wouldn't the better message be to let the best dancer win on their own merits? it would also screw the voting for the others #fairplay

i’ve officially lost the love and respect for one of favorite artist.... @ kanyewest it’s gone too far now … 
just when i thought kanye west was just trying to figure it out, he turns around and say something again that proves he is still in the sunken place! #freekanye #wewanttheoldye 
i am so disappointed in @ scegnews and there’s staffs incompetence and total disregard for life on life’s terms and the negative impact caused to families. #hurt. #outraged. 
you know how women who voted for trump feel? that's how i feel about kanye right now... overwhelmingly 
you have some nerve trying to pass this off as a half of a sandwich. i can’t believe i paid for this. fit in the palm of my hand. sad! #scam @ 
. @ spencerpratt is being a whiney little bitch. after 2 years of watching him on snap he goes and deletes it b/c the latest update dropped his viewership. but the change before that boosted his viewership. he really is a piece of shit just like @ laurenconrad said. 
what happened to your sense of humor girl.

it sucks, i broke my phone because it kept freezing on me when i was playing fire emblem heroes. now i got to get a new one plus it sucks because i have yet to hear if i got hired at a cintas i applied to. #this_week_sucks 
i'm really disappointed in @ getspectrum ...i've been a loyal customer for more than a decade and am trying to work within a budget to upgrade services.. but they are steadfast at not offering any additional discounts other than a new customer discount. 
@ southwestair #southwestairlines didn’t this airline just exercise options for 40 boeing 737 max airplanes worth $4.5 billion? #mightswitchairlinesforever 
@ kfc twice in a row i have ordered a $5 full up ....suppose to come with a biscuit. my favorite part!!! twice i have received no biscuit. #losttrust #givemebojangles 
are you serious, this is a roast. you guys are upset because no one was immune and let's be honest #michellewolf had a power message in the form of a comedy roast. also the #whcd invited her, i'd they weren't happy it's their fault it takes 90 secs to youtube her. 
you would think that @ delta would have reached out for some sort of resolution! nope they sent me a customer service survey instead! #fail #poorservice 
it took two years for you to find me this … 
anybody else feel like they have a razor blade scraping there throat and a cotton wool collection building at their temples? just me then i guess. that’s cool. #springtime #coldandflu #theresalwaysone 
hmmmm. overseas? yes (even paid his own subs and match fees) pro? ? ? (nicest bloke in the world struggling financially, asked the club for help). not sure why you've took a cheap shot at ncc mate?

@ drinkrobinsons hi robinson’s : ) i have just seen your advert for a new refeshinging berry drink using a plastic straw- that goes eventually into the water... being that plastic in our oceans is an epidemic problem, did you not think about this msg? : (

@ dominos is this how your pizzas are always delivered? #dominos – bei dominos pizza

not all @ subway stores offer the $4.99 footlong. 
seriously, @ jessemccartney? i drove 5 hours to “meet and greet” you but all i got was a 2 second photo opt i call bs! only waited 13 years for that moment... 
@ redrobinburgers really wishing you didn't get me hooked on your to go service just to let it slip into terrible quality and garbage service like your half priced competition 
there are so many overpaid @ arsenal players. their lack of fight is embarrassing. #thankyouarsene 
in irish - amadan as a mother, many many with same thought!!!!!!!!!!!! he was reeled out frequently by coalition to justify/reassure it was right. 
reality is different for me. my eyes are open wide enough to see. 
(2/2) donaldtrump. why? ~geraldo rivera let it go george. you have no control and are only harming your wife's position. is that what you want? hurt your wife? 
cheating in morality class. don't have much to say besides the fact that i am... 
@ aircanada very poor logistics and communication getting from #yyz to #yxe. about 4 dozen passengers waiting for their luggage, no communication before takeoff, in flight, or at touchdown. now found out luggage isn't here after 10 minutes waiting at carousel. 
nah, i’m not mad at you just highly fuckin 
@ wendys i ordered the chicken asiago meal. smelled good. mouth watered. got home and opened the wrapper to this utter disappointment. seriously? look at the bacon. and that's how the fries looked. did they count them? cheese isn't even melted. #hungry 
@ stacyadams can we touch base about these shoes i bought from you? called customer service last month and he recommended dr. scholls sa solution. 
@ porterairlines pd393 delay after delay and cancellations, no updates, no compensation. #dontflyporter

i was super excited to order a new sweatshirt, but on a bad day im a size large so on whim i ordered a 2x so that it could be uber big, well their 2x version must mean my arms should shrink 4inches #fail #fanatics #badbuy @ fanatics 
never been more disappointed in a steelers player. have looked up to ben since he came in the league. to say that he basically will not help mentor another player is disgusting, i hope mason is more mature than you @ _bigben7 #pleaseretire 
@ adoreme when is this whole ordering delay going to be over? it’s not cool that you don’t have anything on your website about moving but you are forcing your customers to wait an unreasonable amount of time for their product selling it as 3-5 day. 
@ prvphxcy i supplied you when you was round me ... i was your plug ... i was your dad 
when you get delivery notification for @ lauraleeelay #nudiepatootie that you spent over $100 cad on and can’t wait to get home and see it only to see that it not there hopefully someone grabbed it with their mail by accident and will return it. 
how come every time i go to @ saladworks the roll is either cold or rock hard? 
i expected a better comeback. 
tbh, we are #sad and with you. could you please dm us your information? 
@ wendys was so excited to try the new southwest avacado salad and was such a let down to find the lettuce sitting in a bowl of water and inedible #soggylettuce

this is @ arbys in reynoldsburg ohio's idea of a gyro. #wtfisthis #lazy 
stop going out to eat and not tipping your servers that’s giving you a1 service, shit is ridiculous when you’re coming in someones place of work and demanding shit then can’t afford to tip them.! #stayathome 
sometimes, things will just never work out. making plans and having them fall through suck. i can't remember the last time i felt truly excited about a day and everything worked out. #feelsbad #sadpanda 
nothing is more disappointing then going to grundy to dj and not seeing a single cauliflower ear...... 
@ cubs #cubs think i’ll take a sort of long, ok, long break. if i don’t listen maybe they’ll win. 
@ cedarpoint - 7 coasters closed (8 if you count wicked twister which i can see is not running), plus only@about 1/2 of the kiddie rides open. ocean motion, giant wheel, midway carousel all closed 
such a tragedy for @ officialsteps @ _clairerichards @ faye_tozer @ llatchfordevans @ lslofficial @ ianhwatkins to cancel the event in belfast #tragedy

sorry but isn’t that her strategy? she’s always said a call for a new referendum would be dependent on the final outcome of brexit. she’s publicly said she supports a solution to brexit. wtf are you doing here? in you. give us some real news 
so i was supposed to get my medieval cross tattoo today but the tattooist was ill, so it has to wait until the 15th may! on the plus side i did get some awesome harry potter stuff for my bedroom.

wth, i can’t believe my eldest and favourite daughter could not express her love for me, i am so disappointed and i hate her with all my heart. #disowned 
#ashamed #firecassidy 
poor customer service from @ nowtv says i can cancel online then asks me to call then nobody picks up. @ 
#nhlbruins choked hard core. they were much better then they played in that series. 
i don’t know why @ espn can’t show the #mexicanseries in el paso, tx. i can’t go to mexico to see the game, at least televise it here. 
no talk about 70s sports? 
how long do we have to wait for jpw residential to fix our garage shutter??? 4 weeks & no replies from the calls made to micheal aidoo, he finally sent an email stating it would be fixed on the 4th may. well guess what it never happened. @ jpwnews 
false advertising. not a redhead in sight, not even an unadorned one. 
#rocketleague i'm disappointed that you've missplaced records and can't give me my items that went missing 
disgusted with this behavior! men i don't get it anymore... you know people are going to come forward. and as far as trumpets thinking they have stopped the investigation, luckily their are reputable people to take his place. #believewomen 
for shame . @ bbciplayer how can you let us watch esp 7 of #keepingfaith & then remove final esp from the site? #livid .@evemylesfans 
i traveled to china and i bought basketball shoes brand @ antasportswear. i used them a few minutes and they broke down in the middle of the game #anta

@ timhortons barely a squirt of cream in my boston cream!!! 
so it’s been now 24 mins and the 2nd person was to n phone is not the right department @ att 
@ subwaylistens just tried it app and ordered 2 veggie subs and they were both wrong! to make things worse the store won't answer the phone!! so i would have to say that the app isn't great. 
@ torridfashion you guys should be down right ashamed of yourselves. every time i order there’s an issue tha i have to call 2x to resolve. today is no different- on hold for 1hr today on my 2nd attempt to get a refund for an item never received #customerservice 
i think it’s crazy how these big stars are wearing @ hm gowns to the met gala after the whole monkey hoodie incident. it’s like it never happened. 
typical for @ att. call number for dsl and wait 10+minutes and it’s not even a person or department that works with dsl accounts. 
@ peterfurler and #newsboysunited my boyfriend and i has vip tickets to your lubbock show on saturday but couldn't make it due to last minute health issues, hope you all plan to do this again. 
@ essendonfc @ justinrodski @ xaviercampbell really sad too see that although our membership prices have increased you have cut the birthday cards - nothing from the club at all. i have kept everyone along with my bomber magazine for the past 15years 
thanks, i'm sure that's true but i'm still dealing with the side effects of "peaches & cream" being discontinued. the only moisturizer i have ever used. #bringbackpeachesandcream 
so sad there is no way to allow our college-age son to workout @ planetfitness wentzville on our account while we are out of town for a few days. a $20+ day pass is kinda crazy. #wwcfd 
evolution is not only on the positive side of things, people de-evolutionize as well i witness it first hand! in myself for even thinking i would have a supportive ear during this time 
so much to do with this year #metgala theme 
@ 24sevenin aren't you supposed to be 24*7. such an disappointment. we drove into disappointment. #24seven 
@ dairyqueen i don't think i ordered half a hot fudge sundae. 
i thought @ ikeasaudiarabia had the worst delivery service but @ ikeausa certainly deserve the title 
my thoughts on @ destinythegame plus expansions. i would have felt more rewarded spending the $100 on v bucks. #fortnite 
@ starbucksuk think it's about time your staff were educated on how to use your systems! i have a starbucks card and the only time it's counted towards my rewards in 3 years was yesterday evening!!!!! absolutely not on! probably spent in excess of £500 #fail 
now go find your knees and ask god for forgiveness. to sell your soul for political gain and do a disservice to our bench while you still served. shame on you. a child will suffer because of you. #improvidentlygranted 
can’t trust anybody these days. everybody has a hidden agenda. 
right @ british_airways we are going to fall out! please, by the time we fly home can you get your heads round #glutenfree food. it doesnt mean we are diary free and it doesn’t mean we want to eat nothing but fruit, but today’s offering was dire! spot the difference! 
'"we've never seen traffic on ticketmaster like that before but everything went very smooth," kurtz said tuesday.' i'm sorry, no. it was not smooth. if it was smooth, i'd have tickets instead of seeing the hundreds of tickets for sale at a higher price on stubhub. 
poor adventures, 2 muffins and two strikes. is this what equates to a expansion? #bungie #destiny2 
@ chickfila can you tell your portage location that shafting the teachers and not offering free sandwiches like the rest of y’all is not appreciated. 
@ nationalpro as an emerald elite member who is used to getting a car worthy of the amount of $ i spend with @ nationalpro i could not be more disappointed with my experience today at the des moines airport location, especially for an existing reservation 
is your business doing so poorly for being a junk store that bad you need a minimum purchase in order to get a bag? sheesh i just want to know are you going to charge me the remaining $19.55 i owe u for the bag though? #nickelanddimingpeople #areyouserious 
@ miltontransit @ townofmilton @ mike_cluett why is bus #5-yates, always late or doesn't show up at all? our go train arrives @6:10pm & we end up taking #31 central zone along w/go train arriving @6:25pm. every other bus routes come and go together. #miltonon 
smh fake fan … 
was really looking forward to drinking this. sadly i thought it had the aftertaste of benylin cough medicine 
it’s not you then 
@ keeblerelves i’m pretty sure there’s supposed to be more than two mini cookies in this bag. #wheremycookiesat #rippedoff 
#genderquake #genderquakedebate was poorly managed & should have been better controlled by @ channel4 either do it in a private studio or do it so the audience can ask questions. of course there will be hecklers from both sides. it’s a real life issue not a game show 
when did we get to a point in life where we celebrated people's failures instead of their successes? why can't everyone want one another to do well in life? #beagoodperson 
saw the picture before reading the text and got mistakenly excited that something at #metgala was related to white chocolate buttons! 
that scene in infinity war when they’re in vormir and meet up with red skull i 100% thought he was a dementor. that being said, crossover opportunity missed @ marvel 
why is this news? 
it really sucks to watch a local band finally get a foot in through the door, only to find out that they're using drugs along for the ride. 
please #nintendo, #savethesaves! you can't be the only company doing this type of things.... 
@ homedepot i cannot believe no one has responded to our complaints on a table we purchased that is falling apart. the description of the table on the website has rust free. look at this pic you will see it has lots of rust! #homedepot #poorcustomerservice 
preachhhh!!! they’re doing absolutely the bare minimum and they don’t give a f**k 
@ ubereats i really hate to be that customer but when i make an order and it arrives without all of the requested items it is good practice to offer a discount or at least a coupon for upcoming orders. instead, i get nothing but a weak "sorry" #badcustomerservice 
@ bbyboynextdoor so i thought i found you on snapchat. to my surprise, some chick is using your handle. 
why should i get a #bmw @ bmwcanada ? when my friend is forced to make service appt online to @ buddsbmwham then it is cancelled? people are busy w life, really inconvenient. narrows my list for a new car based on this #customerservice experience 
rant: mcdicks messed up my order and i got someone else’s burger when i just wanted fries. i went back to correct it and they let me keep the burger and i’m just wondering what kind of sick person doesnt get pickles on their burger..... 
i've been at the zoo all day and have yet to see any children get snatched up by gorillas. fucking media hype. #fakenewsforum 
@ mattressfirm so we are only training your employees to treat customer right to make the purchase? so that way once that cars or cash is given your customer is being treated like dirt? #horriblecustomerservice 
i thought he was going to be feeding eagles! 
i think alex turner will unfollow me after this tweet. if you don’t treat your fellow - talented - band members as your equals... just go solo. #arcticmonkeys 
@ camelbak i bought an expensive #camelbak water bottle from my university, supposedly leak-proof... within months it began leaking anytime i tried to use it... 
and that is why i will never move back to elkhart. … 
i only tweet a few times a year... this tweet is brought to you by my devastation over brooklyn nine-nine being cancelled. #brooklyn99 
unbelievably disappointing.. with all the build-up, i was really looking forward to on-boards, live races and unedited team radio. what do i get? shit i can find for free on youtube, basically. what a let down. please fix this asap #f1tv 
really sad if mccain said that 
yo, @ virginmedia why is my newish replacement superhub 3 such a piece of hot garbage? my smart home doesn’t work when either your service or the hub (whichever causes these errors) doesn’t work... #doubtingvalue #doubtingspeed 
you’re working for playstation: i set the system up as guided and introduced guidelines for my kids. however, it’s a new experience for some of us, surely playstation should appreciate that and not just hide behind well-worded t&cs 
psa: @ rainforest_cafe in las vegas volcano dessert does not come with a sparkler. which isn’t a problem unless it’s the entire reason you are there. 
just got these @ newbalance mzanton 3’s and have less than 50 miles on them and they already have sever wear on them. highly disappoint. 
@ americanair just spoke to a representative on the phone to rebook a ticket. they were not friendly and we got disconnected. not even a call back. #poorcustomerservice #americanair 
ag sessions buys time from contempt of congress via @ saracarterdc @ tgowdysc what is ag sessions doing? we need a replacement! 
@ gmcanada i'm a little disappointed in our new #chevsilverado it's in being fixed the ac condenser is not working. been over 10 years since our last #gm vehicle because of poor quality. i hope it gets better! 
still not acceptable. there is an excuse every thursday night when i am on this flight! #veryangry #southwestairlines 
@ samsung837 thanks for letting me register for an event, reminding me about it, then changing the rules so i can't attend without notice. 
#ipoet #fraud ...not waiting ...i know what you are...many will be 
i gotta stop setting myself up for disappointment...i keep believing in the same people...hoping that they will show me someone different... forgetting that they will always look out for themselves first. 
uhm why does @ kraftbrand kd taste like cardboard lately. so much for no artificial flavor #nolongermycomfortfood 
@ aircanada when you ask a perfect seat holder to move for a child who’s seat is broken the least you can do is offer a free flight 
i am very sad about the cancellation of the crossing. that show is really good and deserved another season and more! i'll keep watching until the finale though. #thecrossing 
lucifer getting cancelled after three amazing seasons really hurts...i wish it could of lasted until at least season 7 or 8. this show deserved better. it was unique and so good! #luciferonfox 
super upset that @luciferonfox got canceled!!! #savelucifer its one of my favorite shows!!! im so pissed off right now! what in the devils heavens are you doing @ foxtv lets see #luciferonnetflix or #lucifercw 
so like i drank my first energy drink today ( a monster) and honestly that shit didn’t do anything to me 
really?! you couldn't go with "they (windmills) might be giants" as a title? or something similarly in line with your usual pop-culture allusions?! 
just watched the notebook. why did you cut the ending @ netflixuk ? ruined the film for the sake of a few seconds. #annoyed #sad 
are these meant to be cheese and bacon fries? #whereisthecheese #cheesehunt 
@ coverscanada i ordered window coverings from the stoney creek / hamilton location and i have never been so disappointed in my life. i know it is not the sales persons fault hence the tweet? #paidinfull #still no window coverings installed customer

whatever i’m doing, pixie is certain it’s not as important as petting her. #cat 
when you pay extra for a box of @ snyders_hanover to avoid them being broken and yet there was only a few that were not..

. @ sendonnelly please at least pretend you’re a democrat. do you really think you’re going to gain republican hoosier votes by voting for a trump nominee? you’ll be responsible for torture in the future. … 
@ proflowers @ proflowerscs my children sent me mother’s day flowers for our dinner table center piece. here is how they should look and how they looked upon arrival. how disappointing! i certainly expected better from your company. #proflowers #mothersday2018

there so meny better songs then this … 
@ papajohns i sent a dm but just in case you guys didn't get it. this is just crazy! i'm done with this store! #badcustomerservice #retrain 
just got home from work.. debating to go to @ shakybeats ... missed out on @ ookay & @ bonniexclyde ... until next time .. 
first time in years i have watched and actually been invested. so proud of @ ryan_acoustic and the reaction of the crowd!! i had faith because the standard was so high, finally it was more about the songs #eurovision 
first year i've watched (and even enjoyed) #eurovision in years and then it ends in disappointment. #israel entry was a terrible, gimmicky song. so many better ones #wontbewatchingnextyear 
@ mcdonalds hey mcdonald’s why’d you get rid of lemonade; my favorite drink. it’s summer, lemonade it’s the drink of summer. #mcdonalds #lemonade 
@ syfy by the gods why would you cancel the expanse??? it’s like your network does not like quality programming. farscape, battlestar galactica, and now the expanse. but you’ll keep wwe? that has nothing to do with scifi! 
as a #eurovision fan who always respects and supports the show and the artisits i must say that this one was by far the most ridiculous one 
thought he’d be more stoked. 
i can't embrace a feminism that comes wrapped in cultural appropriation and hypocrisy #eurovision #isr 
noooooo i wanted cyprus to win. where were our votes from ireland and malta? 
um i just wanna sayyy i was in rancho cucamonga and i didn’t see any of you. @ uncleblazer @ ders808 @ adamdevine 
also @ united you have put me in a hotel and given me food coupons. thanks. but this hotel doesn’t have a restaurant for me to redeem those coupons.... #wtf #iwanttobeinnycalready 
unbelievable! the liam gallagher and richard ashcroft show was cancelled last minute due to “technical difficulties”. thanks to the @ sonycentreto both for the late notice and not getting the safety issues worked out. #planning @ liamgallagher @ richardashcroft 
hey @ bellsbrewery ... opened an oberon and poured it into a glass. found a worm in it. it was still moving. so disgusting and ruined my favorite beer for me. 
about to leave to take my wife on her birthday to see liam gallagher and richard ashcroft at the sony centre for 8pm and got notice at 7:08 that the show has been cancelled due to an electrical issue. unbelievable! #wtf @ sonycentreto @ liamgallagher @ richardashcroft 
@ bwwings why do you now give less wings per size? large used to be 24, now it’s 20 
@ olivegarden we called almost two hours ago, dinner was supposed to be ready at 6pm. this dinner is about the size of a child’s portion. seriously, this is my mother’s day dinner? 
as a borderline ace/demisexual, i am still miffed that "netflix and chill" doesn't actually mean "netflix and chill" because watching netflix with a big bowl of popcorn cuddled up to your favorite person is my idea of a good night. #ace 
i’m shook...what is this?? @ takisusa :( 
#moodatthemoment 
this immigration stuff is old copy and paste from old messageboard, right? ... i thought russian bots were more up to date and original. in russia. :( 
@ tartecosmetics still on this road to nowhere 
@ captainds i chose your restaurant today because healthy options were part of the menu, but a salad that’s not edible isn’t really healthy. old iceberg salad mix that’s turning brown just doesn’t cut it. 
so i booked our hotel over a month ago, but turns out i’m not #allin and instead i’m 
i thought i was getting spoiled by @ southwestair when a new -800 plane pulled up. too bad it's late and the wifi is broken! 
i’m trying to decide how ‘this’ is making me feel. i get it...i understand...i guess #toomanyemotions 
so very disappointed that an hour after the tix went on sale, people already are gouging on stub hub. #allin and 
@ mimiscafe not digging the forced limited menu... especially for the price... 
i thought brown cared about the disabled. about the poor. that's what his platform says. but he starts speaking and target than talking about how horrible the schools are period, he singled out minorities. and then he just went off the rails. i'm so 
was so excited for the @ aerlingus direct flights out of seattle but after the 30+ minute hold times, wrong answers & bad direction i remember why i don't fly them even when it's a shorter flight or less $$. #customerserviceisalostart #noirishhospitality 
always thought his voice should sound like gilbert godfrey 
why does every music festival but ours have a throwback and childish gambino and actual pop artists. c’monnnnnnnn @ liveatfirefly #sad #shouldagottt @ dualipa @ donaldglover @ officialabbafan 
@ sprezzabox first time wearing my may socks and they ripped on bottom. help please? #clothing #sprezza 
reading this tony pike - ibiza legend book. 5 chapters in... dreadful! nothing of any note been read, no funny stories/memories just all about sexual encounters with all these different women. i'm getting the word.. nonce! very bland 
@ calpizzakitchen frozen to-go salads in the airport. that’s a new concept and totally not worth $12. 
knew i shouldn't have gotten my hopes up about this.

why am i being told something that is not true? i as a consumer don’t ‘work towards’ paying amazon for their endeavours right. when i buy something i pay up. i expect amazon to deliver on the ambition not be in a constant state of pursuit... come on. #notfair 
what?? @ cbcasithappens is doing a story about a 165 km/h shed and @ realjeffdouglas doesn’t use the pun “cabin speeder?” #shedhumour @ caroloffcbc

dear school officials, there are some pretty specific things i’d like to tell you to do with these fines but i’ll be respectful. you can make him work off the fines for not bringing his badge and you can also stop letting him use his badge as a credit card. 
@ jetblue would like to enjoy the entertainment. flight from san to ffl the jack was screwed up. going back they had to reset the system 20 minutes into the post, then the movies were different, black panther wouldn't play and then my screen crapped out. #wtf

@ stoolpresidente umberto’s is amazing i can never take your pizza reviews seriously again 
@ jeremyclarkson you said #threebillboardsoutsideebbing was a good film. overall good but lame ending! 
wtf why? why are they erasing this? so not watching now. 
are you fr? i just wasted 1:47 minutes of my life. 
umm, if you’re so worried, why are you voting “yes” to promoting a torturer and an evidence destroyer?! wtf are you thinking! #unreal

@ jetblue flight 1347 - i was supposed to take off at 5:55pm but now i’m not taking off until 8:56pm because you couldn’t find a first officer for my flight? are you kidding? you’re flying one in from boston because there wasn’t a single one closer to charleston? 
so disappointed in my roses that i bought @ costco yesterday. they wilted already. only 24 hrs #roses #fail 
@ kia case #12634275 the paint continues to bubble and peel off my 2012 #kiasoul. 3 months i have dealt with #customerservice. 2.5 pages of notes detailing unreturned calls, being passed from one case manager to another.

@ cruzesquivia...no apkbl mention at track and field banquet?

i’m thinking of taking back my follow. 
but wait...how is it only 630 pm et and @ worldbean runs out of the food and coffee advertised on the menu. not some, but all. only pastries and regular coffee are left. i had my taste buds ready for the “hot latin lover” coffee special. – bei john f. kennedy international airport (jfk) 
@ starbucks i love you guys, but no cold brew and no drink carriers there are 5 other stores in a ten minute drive can they not borrow from other stores...

#disappointed. 
gonna haveto pass on black ops 4. disappointing. classes that can see through walls. no single player. multiplayer looks like a 15$ blops 3 dlc. remaking mob to boost sales cause the rest of the game is iffy. nice. #blackops4 #motd

@ hubspot how easy is it to migrate from zoho? 
@ virginatlantic why, oh, why do you promote the 787 dreamliner on a route and then swap in a 15 year old a340 at the last minute? i specifically chose you over ba for the 787, and now i'm not looking forward to my flight with you next week anymore. already...

i went to @ chilis for some baby back baby back ribs, and when i get there they had no ribs #wheremyribat 
@ yankees it’s pretty sad that the fans at away games can’t get autographs of their favorite players that they hardly get to see. today only stanton signed for a few people. everyone went right into the bus. not even kids got autos that were waiting. 
i found out that the laptop i have connected to my tv has been running at a 29 hz refresh rate instead of 60 hz... this has explained a lot. this has been going on for a couple of years too 
@ doordash i’m very disappointed. i ordered from a place that’s 2 miles away but you routed it to one 24 minutes away?! food was cold. soda watered down. and you still have my address wrong. time to try #ubereasts i guess. #doordash

@ eastonotley no disrespect to the staff or yp at all as were amazing but not a big day out like last year, which was great. shouldn’t have to pay £5 for what was an info event. poor turn out, reflected poor event. 
today's meal at @ bdsmongolian was probably the most substandard meal i've ever had in the 10 years i've dined at bd's. all i could taste was char and hints of ash and i had three shrimp tails. paid for my meal anyways because i ate it. #disappointed. 
wow .... i hear this “selfish” word at almost every training event .. however i would expect a columnist to choose a topic she is knowledgable about ....able to craft a quality insightful response ... here

@ papajohns i just got my pizza but with no breadsticks like i ordered... and they came late too

@ deltaassist @ delta the gate attendant at mco gate 75 just questioned my foot injury as i preboarded. my foot is fractured & she said “this is preboarding” in rude tone. i told her i have an injury & then said “oh”. so rude & uncomfortable. isn’t this against hippa? 
last august i tweeted that i got my first pair of @ georgiaboot and it wasn't going to be my last. i blew those boots out in 7 months and won't buy another pair. didn't even get my money out of them.

that’s very sneaky of you not making that clear in the letter, would also have been useful to include what our current plan/discounts we currently get, but this would have given away the info you just disclosed. will now test the market @ originenergy @ aus_red_energy 
@ speakerryan really turned out to be a pos. 
there may be many “culture wars” in this country, @ washingtonpost, but issues of discrimination & equal treatment aren’t that. bias & discrimination of any sort should never, ever be termed a “culture war”. … 
let's see what new gear is in store today.... uh... oh. #splatoon2 
after thinking on this for a few days i find it very disheartening. to think a prominent cardiologist and public figure @ drjkahn would not only recommend taking supplements before having your blood tested but to suggest that you don’t need to have one at all... 
hmmm...dont waste the gas...doesn't look like the ad... 
#wnbalive not a good way to start the season. can’t even watch the games being advertised...gonna lose a lot of fans and followers... 
@ stateofdecay yup that's it, just lost my leader, best vehicle and a bunch of supplies due to a really bad glitch/bug. i'm done with this series, loved the first one too.

why does the second season of 13 reasons why remind me sooo much of pretty little liars 
i'm new to twitter and what i learned to today is that 240 characters leaves one vulnerable to having their words twisted.the adoption community is small and should be able to have intelligent, thoughtful conversations without attacks or belittling one. #surprised 
you’re creating me a huge economic damage and plus i was supposed to be home by now already instead i’m still trying to get back to london! 
unbelievable how twisted these kids have become. #sad 
i always thought the devil was smarter 
i've just ended #thegoodwife and i have to say that... i hate open endings, i would like to know what happened next but still, this tv show was amazing 
i need answers now 
@ sharktankau the baby doll deal segment was so highly edited that viewers didn't find out price of baby doll, how much to make, where it's made & how, etc. all you were interested in was the guy stumbling to remember numbers and steve walking out. #disappointed. 
@ ring i feel like this is bad customer service. guess i will buy a @ nest. #fail #customerservice 
you're not wearing black here.

@ kfc this is pretty pathetic considering it costs over $10. 
am i the only one who’s getting tired of @ att it’s overpriced and the service is #horrible i’ve never missed a payment and at this point i’m paying for a service that they aren’t delivering...they’ve been to my place 3x to “fix” the issue and changed my modem 3x 
@ electricstyles1 i recently purchased led high top sneakers for edc. i was so disappointed in your product! on day 1 the right shoe failed to light up. i was so . i purchased them specifically for #edc it ruined my outfit #badproduct

ugh, after hearing so many great things about @ theblacktux on reddit & yelp, their customer service is terrible. leaving a lot to be desired, and putting me in a position where i might have to just go with another company :( 
with the #hansolo movie...in-spite of being a big fan got so bored that thought of leaving the theatre at one point. with amazing sci-fi shows such as #theexpanse on tv, movies need to do more than just following a formula 
having just acquired my first @ moleskine notebook i am really disappointed that your website directs every thing to the notebook page, regardless of where you select. guess i won't be adding a bag after all. #shame #notasgoodasyourselfpromotion

when you have to make a second trip to @ bostonmarket because they don’t give you you’re entire order. i go back and the apparent manager was rude insinuating that it was my fault. and she didnt do anything wrong. rolling her eyes a few times. #terribleservice #rude 
i was told there was cookies. 
@ office365 account frozen. trying to just buy 5gb storage and it won't let me keeps trying to get me to buy office365. absolute blackmail over my files, photos of my kids etc. why can't i buy just storage? 
@ leejeans why don’t you make jeans for real men? not everyone wants to wear tampered slim fit skinny jeans. 
champions league to say the least #lfc #nexttime

nothing here, either 
never using @ carnivalcruise again! their website has false advertisement. really sucks when the tickets are already pricey and you don’t even get what you think is included. for anyone who plans on using them double check what’s actually included 
ok well that is nowhere near as cool 
if anyone thought the message from @ macys to privately dm them meant they would help with my jewelry defect, think again. purchased jewelry from @ kohls, returned for a full refund 3 months later. i only wanted an exchange. #shopsmall

@ hiltonhotels had the worst stay ever at your olympia hotel in london this weekend. to say that we've had no assistance for my wife as a wheelchair user is a massive understatement. we've made the best of it because we've had no alternative. #accessibilitymatters 
i've scrolled through 20 tweets and not one person has pointed out it's *their #grammarhammer 
@ mariners @ marinerspr @ safecofieldeats bought club level seats to try the lobster roll. they ran out before the 5th inning.

wow. shuda fimed it. we have had nothing here. no rain. no lightning. nothing. 
i went to go see avengers infinity war at @ mysantikos. it was really quiet throughout the movie. also, the subwoofer cabinets rumbled as if the wood casings were loose and were coming apart. also the pop corn tasted stale and chewy. 
@ babcockdairy @ memorialunion . if i wanted plain vanilla i wouldn’t have ordered union utopia. #disappointed. still a beautiful day at the terrace. 
@ doubletree my boyfriend and i are so excited to be in charleston sc, but pretty grossed out by your hotel. we found a bottle used lube by the bed upon arrival. we told the front desk and got a half-hearted apology. 
i was hoping this was the fight announcement for you vs. wilder. give the man the 40% if you’re so hungry. #please 
@ bluejays #bluejays @ mlb head trainer set women back years. #joshdonaldson @ bringerofrain20 didn’t need her arm around him as he left the field.

#carsharefinale i know i'm in the minority on twitter but i wish they'd left us with the original ending. just didn't think it was that good. i suppose i'm just thinking about the finale of #theoffice which i thought was brilliant #carshare 
@ bristolfarms the worse check out experience in 20 years at the south pasadena location. lorissa was rude and did not know any of the codes. #rudechecker

these people #windrush deserve all the help possible. but david was my mp i got no help from him at all. … 
where is x6 ?? @ sarvikas 
you're one of them!! 
went to the movies to relax a little but @ amctheatres really upset me tonight. rude employees at the front desk, 2 cashiers working the concessions while 4 stood talking in the back, had to wait 10 minutes for the snack i wanted. i’ll go to @ regalmovies next time 
for a second, i thought you were wearing bunny ears in this pic 
my grandma didn't call and sing happy birthday to me yesterday. being an adult sucks #tooold #adulting

@ pusha_t dear drake and pusha stop tearing each other down. black men you all have enough against you in this world. 
melania, #wethepeople actually have a vested interest in you and you family. your husband works for us. you are free to do what you want. we were ‘promised’ the ‘greatest first lady ever’. 
dear drake and pusha stop tearing each other down. black men you all have enough against you in this world. 
so here i am again with @ mariepoland3 having to defrost my @ samsung rf24fsedbsr as i do every 3 months or so 
and, as with all press questions, she provided no direct response to the question. #shslies 
does the complaint actually get to the driver? at the end of work day it’s very aggravating and people just want to get home. i couldn’t believe my eyes when he was literally making fun at me. he gets paid to be on the road. 
that's who @ drake chose to get pregnant?!! suddenly he's no longer attractive to me #sellout #why #outofallthewomen 
@ mcdonalds please bring back the strawberry sundae to your canadian stores. 
feeling disappointed wanted to attend yoga tonight but got sick feeling & it’s not passing... #yoga #sucks #sick 
when you bought an @ apple macbook in 2007 and have been happily using it ever since, and said company removes your ability to sync your iphone or utilize the online functions of itunes you have to ask yourself if this is how brand loyalty is rewarded. 
"all" doesn't mean "all" at #oldnavy buyer beware. no exclusions on the website. none on the giant sign in the window. they're in 8pt font on the sign above the product. 
me neither. 
bad experience with @ metlife. on the phone with them for over 45 minutes today and still no satisfactory resolution. need a new insurance company! 
#fallout76 might actually be a online survival game like dayz and rust then #pokemonletsgo has no wild pokemon battles...what a double whammy to ruin your day.

@ disneyparks and the #fastpass lines are a joke. the wait is longer than standby. 
i can't believe you just tweeted such statement! so tired of #hollywood!! 
so...all my 'date reads' on goodreads are gone. all right, lesson learnt. i won't solely rely on goodreads anymore and use an old school notebook beside it. 
@ vancityreynolds having me sit through an extra 5 minutes for a post credit of #deadpool2 that didn't even happen.

@benlevitt2018 why are you not attending the all candidates meeting in dundas this evening? #whereareyoulevitt 
so they did apologize, at the end of the visit, asked rapid fire questions about me while staring at computer screen and minimal eye contact throughout, just a lot of clicking... #timetoswitchpcps 
you kiss your grandkids with that mouth? fine example ms. fields, fine example. 
shunting #groovemusic pass last year was a kick in the teeth. discontinuing apps on ios and android is kicking us while we are still down … 
went by @ tmobile to upgrade but quickly realized that they had nothing for existing customers. 
@ attcares your chat is disappointing! my bills are completely different than what i was quoted before i switched to you. i completely regret switching providers. 
i’m truly crushed right now. smh feeling some type of way.

wow @ cplenergy has increase their kilowatts off the charts. #time2change 
i know you cant please everyone @ denvercomiccon but i am super #sad that @ garrettrwang and @ clarekramer don't seem to be moderating this year. they are amazing and i always look forward to them keeping the panels entertaining and on point. 
#hansolo - first #starwars movie i'm not watching for the 2nd time in the cinema. #lucasfilm 
i love #prowrestling i love #wwe but business decisions like this really make me question if they have any values at all, or are they just no informed? 
really upset that’s there was no spanchat filter for national donut day... @ snapchat 
i demand a reprint!! show some respect!! #reprint #magazine 
i thought we were out of the woods... why are people so stupid? why go back to someone who hurt you so badly? why the self-loathing? there’s more people in the world, you know... #stupidhumans 
i wish i knew how to fix an "unknown error" where do i go from here..?? #nogif 
add sally field. 
super disappointed in #alaskaairlines - flight cancelled, terrible customer service, basically had to find my new flight for the rep on the phone. vacation shortened, money lost, terrible start to my summer vacation! no apologies given... i expected more. 
man...drove 1500 miles to see a @ dbacks game and my first experience was a terrible one. the level of indignation and indifference encountered when trying to get a ticket printed and find the team store was almost enough to send me home. 
@ tacobell drop your sponsorship of that vile human being, samantha bee. 
@ snickers drop your sponsorship of that vile human being, samantha bee. 
mom, i really wish you had remembered that it’s #nationaldonutday... 
talked several times today to a banker at our local branch. they weren't very helpful. 25 plus years as a customer obviously means nothing to them. 
and here i thought you were a grammar police... smh #grammar 
@ dyson so my v6 battery dies just after warranty runs out...so i’ve got to pay £60 for a new battery...convenient! think i’ll be looking into the old trusty wired vacuum cleaner instead @ dysonuk 
@ dunkindonuts really? 3 stores i visit and not one of them has a single donut. the word donut is in your name!!! #dunkindonuts 
of all people #sallyfield you showed your #truecolors and it's ugly like your comments. no matter what your politics. i'm sorry i ever supported your income by seeing any of your work #sad 
i expected it to be more liquidy and alcohol-y. #zima 
@ target we bought this fire pit late summer and use the provided cover and went to use it for the first time this season and it looks like this. spent over $300 and i assumed it would last longer than 10 months. 
@ dominos pizza just got delivered and the toppings are stuck to the lid. #bentbox 
@ vincecamuto fyi, wore your americana parka in the rain today, trying to enjoy my first time at the coveted rva greek festival, and got wet... underneath the jacket. #itsdamp 
@ skyuk too many times you’ve messed up a night of tv viewing. so much for ultra fast download speeds #snailpace 
not such a great mental health day had. came home to be with kitters. 
@ upshelp is it so hard for your drivers to ring the doorbell? or to ask they not drop my boxes on the porch so hard that i heard it from the second floor with the windows closed and a/c on? i guess i should be glad the sound alerted me to a delivery #bellsr4ringing 
@ texasroadhouse we have been waiting to be seated for 45 min to be seated! #sad #hangry 
i always believed that when i become 25 yo my powers would be unlocked.. it’s been four months.. 
@ gwrhelp can not believe how long it took to be informed of a problem with the 23:20 train! could have made the 23:23 had you let us know sooner. #unimpressed 
liar u didn’t share the pics 
@ rudysbbq today's take-away from the outlet on 620 in austin was pretty awful. the "extra moist" brisket was super dry and bitter. the baby back ribs were dry and tasteless. the chopped spicy sausage was dry. 
waited all week to go boating and then hit by torrential rains as i head to the dock. whatever i have done to offend you mother nature, i’m truly sorry. 
what sadness there is in us when we see that our country has changed. where is the respect? where are the good manners? where is the education? etc. etc. they have been totally lost!!! … 
@ vuecinemas 23:15 for a 23:00 movie and the lights have only just dimmed. nothing on screen at all. 
@ kanyewest ........... seriously??? 
@ tgifridays hello! just fyi, your indy 86th st. location isn’t honoring your $12.99 ribs deal, even though we just saw the tv ad promoting the deal this morning. 
my children were so excited to ride their bikes in the new @ islandiavillage memorial park today and there are no bikes allowed? really? what kind of a park is this? 
@ chipotletweets how am i supposed to eat this?

@ southwestair you’ve been my go-to for a long time but 2 out of my last 3 flights have lacked the customer service i’ve always valued. i’m hoping this isn’t a new pattern. #perplexed #southwest

what is up with @ sephora’s #rewardsbizarre?! i have placed two orders in the last two days and the point reward section is severely lacking its usual luster. #vibrouge 
my @ dollarshaveclub trial box shipped on 5/29, but won’t be here until 6/7? this is not a good start to a long relationship..... 
such hypocrites in b30, change their complete judgement on something as soon as it benefits them. i get we’re young and still finding our feet but to be so passionate of a set of morals to then being so careless is madness. 
@ foodnetwork what is going on with iron chef judges. anthony anderson?? clearly says he has no clue what he’s doing. 
in thorsby and didn’t see @ tlangester 
@ easportsfifa you messed up the moroccan team, you forgot one key player ayoub elkaabi #negligated 
@ karlravechespn looks like 30 minutes best now for tonight's baseball tonight? why doesn't @ espn just start the show on espnews? there's no live programming on right now. 
i spent my 6 hours in the car being so unprodcutive. i could have at least listened to a book or a podcast 
messy room. long lines. no hot water. brown dirty water. noisy neighbours. no response from manager. @ hiltonhotels @ hiltonnewsroom @ hiltonatlanta

@ bts_twt 
@ thegreatkhalid u lip sing like a bitch coulda been at third eye blind smh 
this is the worst possible decision. i was really hoping they would have moved it to the up-swipe on the iphone instead of the down-swipe on the ipad. … 
sorry to say i will no longer watch the #eagles. tire of the political bs. 
by my lifelong team. shame on you. … 
@ bacheloretteabc , so theres a bigot/racist,a man with gross bathroom issues and a guy who sends pics of his private parts to women w/ offensive comments, great castings and vetting there, this season had gone down the toilet, literally! 
am i the only one who is upset that @ apple didn’t announce a new ipad with face recognition? in the big reveal:( 
@ lgusamobile so i needed a new phone & the @ sprint store convinced me to try the lg v30+ over another android brand. it's a change & seems like a good phone but why don't you have the led notification feature?? not a fan of not having it. 
wow. politic much? seriously, you need to reread what your correct role in our system entails. #trumpsamerica 
6 months past warranty and i’m told my @ pioneerusa turntable will be $230 to fix. i barely used it. i thought their products were good! lots of ppl with the same problem and no recall! #plx500 
so they can sit in jail, miss votes while you and msnbc spend another week litigating bill clinton? seriously- there was more moral outrage this am about 20 years ago than those children being held in such conditions 
even if you've achieved a lot. you've went to a lot of different places. you've met a lot of good people. but when they say, 'bakla naman yan, wala yang mararating...' it all burns down and falls off to pieces. #angsakittalagamadiscriminate #notohomophobes 
@ dominos not impressed with online ordering. can’t pay online from the location selected for me and can’t change store location to one the accepts online payment

@ johnfowlerhols a little disappointed so far on my first day @trelawne manor. travelled 10 hours and everything seems broken? 
so @ scotus ? what are your thoughts on the following? #historyrepeating #equalityforall 
trying to remain diplomatically non controversial with comments about the standard of our outfield @ ebbwvalecc following the work of an outside contractor is proving very difficult indeed. i will not say anymore 
only to discover that #kingscross wouldn't let me get two fandom photos done the trolley at platform 9 3/4 was gone #wherediditgo #harrypotter 
@ thefive jessie’s one more thing was in such poor taste. 
our son left for vacay with friends today. house is quiet. hubs thought this perfect time to try @ soothe for our first time. great idea until one of our masseuses cancelled 1 hour before their arrival time. #unimpressed 
all they had to do is stick to the season. #southerncharm 
hey @ duchessct, maybe next time cook the fries??? #fries 
i have finally come to the realization that the basket of clean laundry i’ve been moving around for a week is not going to fold itself. #selffoldingwardrobeplease

@ horrorhoneys finally got around to watching the boy. utterly predictable. it hinted at 2 decent twists; instead, it ended up being 100% average.

@ amazon you always overpackage everything until the one time i needed you to. my hubby is not going to be surprised about his father's day gift now. #amazon #fathersday 
@ presssec it’s my understanding that you’re a religious, god-fearing woman with a deep faith. i don’t know about the god that you worship, but mine says lying is a sin, which you appear to do with some regularity. 
i was waiting on a headbutt 
the question isn't about if you liked the character or not. its the fact that the woman was harassed. there was no need for that to happen. #starwars 
@ 13reasonswhy for a show about helping teens, why didn’t you address clay hallucinating the whole season2?

i've been with @ verizon since 2009, have loved them since. today, seems like their customer service has taken a downfall. i tried to chat & was told i would be helped soon, waited for an hr, no help. i called & the rep that answered didn't seem like he cared.

trying to ride in the new bike lane on washington st in @ cityofhoboken is more dangerous than if it wasn’t there. if double parkers aren’t going to be ticketed significantly (moving violation / pts) than we might as well get rid of the bike lanes. @ ravibhalla

i decided to be #kind. not because i want the #world to be kind back to me but because i want to be kind to it. don't ever have #expectations if you're doing something or act somehow. you'll be then. 
like honestly today went no where like how i wanted it to. 
incredible 2 is so boring! my gf slept half of the movie 
this was the first concert in a decade where i have not bought a drink, due to the prices. all they did was motivate me to byob. @ livenation, i thought you were better than this.

as a prolife site why are you not holding this administration to account for their evil immigration policies separating children from their parents? it's unconscionable and your support of him undermines everything you stand for. 
@ littlecaesars you really need to get store 00001-00302 to get their act together. i don’t mind waiting now and then but when your employees start giving out the same pizza or to someone who was inline 2 behind me really isn’t good. the “apology” i got was lacking.

went to @ dairyqueen today to indulge in a sweet treat, only to be told they were serving no products because their machine was down! whose ice cream machine(s) go down in the middle of the summer? #ireallywantedablizzard #savedmesomecalories #wenthomecrying 
when all you want from your kid is a good night txt to let you know they are ok. why is that so difficult in this age of mega communication.

on contrary why a @ cmomaharashtra is allowing and justifying even a dummy weapon showoff ,on any occasion...? doesn't that terrorize people...? what kind of culture does @ dev_fadnavis follows..? @ anjali_damania @ free_thinker @ sunetrac @ jigneshmevani80 @ mirrornow

what happened to the courteous flight crew that @ southwestair brags about? two flights in one weekend and i’d have to say they don’t exist. sad. 
@ avis $323 for a 14-hour rental seems a tad pricey. flight complications extended my family vacation a day and i was looking for help. didn’t think i would get taken advantaged of like this. 
the guac at @ chipotletweets was covered with a metal lid. i should have known why...ordered it and it was brown goop on my bowl.

just witness a white guy walk a full three rows further down the train to wake up a guy who was sleeping and move his bags so that he wouldn’t have to sit next to a minority who was awake with a completely open seat again, it’s 2018 how is racism a thing?

everyone's right. this is all to make us bi+ch to our cable company to carry fs2 at extremely high price. make it a part of our regular cable package. disrespect to nascar fans. the other show reairs for those who missed it but race hub doesn't.

a little too much repetition of ‘where did we come from? where are we going?’ i had to read through 100s of pages of over descriptive hype and fluff for a single hypothetical theory?? #danbrownorigin 
just got done watching #theboldtype with @ t_mece and i am unfortunately disappointed in yet another cheating trope that has graced itself on tv. i have loved the writing for this show and this is the first time i've ever been disappointed. 
sorry i think you missed my point. my order number is 343088622. can you confirm it defo won't arrive tomorrow? 
having cp, leveling pokemon by catching them, no wild battles at all!?wow! good job, nintendo, i know what i am not buying or recommending to anyone this year, pokemon go was not supposed to be a role model for a pokemon game. #pokemonletsgo

@ sheetz nice job with the sliders on a bun....errrr tortillas. hamburguesas malas #sarcasm 
@ publicmobile been on the phone for four hours trying to connect with your company to get reimbursed for a failed add-on transaction that should not have gotten charged. i am a loyal customer this is ridiculous! 
i still don’t have any connection up to now. 
evan peters was robbed of the emmys yet again this year. i just hope one day he’ll get the recognition he deserves. his portrayal in every single ahs season is astounding. #ahs #emmynoms @ evan_peters 
ryan: i experienced a silos problem today. my local dodge dealer's marketing group sent me a coupon to come back for an oil change. when i got to the "express lane", i was told there was a 1.25 hour wait. 2 hours later i walked out of there. #eculive2 
insane. i always thought justin bieber and selena gomez would end up together 
apparently @ sonicdrivein thinks "bacon cheeseburger with ketchup and mustard" means i wanted literally only ketchup and mustard. #fail #wantedveggiestoo #boringburger 
i had to turn it off. i was disgusted with both sides. i’d rather watch my regular fox programs. 
@ hellobistro i ordered a hamburger from your beachwood, oh restaurant today and was surprised to see that the meat was very much undercooked for my liking (close to medium-rare). it’s a shame because my husband and i love ordering from your restaurant. 
y’all... @ maallyyhammonds has never seen the loin king so if anyone else wants to be friends, i’m down. 
when @ jimmyjohns doesn’t put the mayo and mustard on your sandwich and don’t give you the kickin ranch!! 
@ tgowdysc you are a real embarrassment. your grandstanding is pathetic. 
@ realreddiwip 2 full cans and neither work 
the @ buildabear voucher is for $15 off. even if my 3 kids got the cheapest bear there it still will cost me more than today would have. someone didn’t think today through. how about a bear for your kids age on their birthday? just saying. #buildabear 
after a great day with the wife, went to @ bostonpizza bridgewater for supper. did not get the steak sandwiches we ordered, the steaks we did get were thin, tough and over cooked, cactus cuts were soggy and the veggies were between cooked and raw. and #stillhungry 
@ walmart why did i bother pre-ordering my #amiibo if i can't even get it on release day? up until yesterday my order was going to arrive today. now it's in indiana somewhere. 
@ panerabread... why the hell was my chocolate chipper cookie half the size today? it cost the same but it was no bigger than a subway cookie... lisbon ct panera bread location

@ comcastcares @ xfinity issues since day 1: 1. my phone no. linked to some one else's account 2. incorrect info/pricing 3. multiple automatically cancelled appts 4. home alarm issues 5. internet keeps dropping. after multiple calls,they have no clue how to fix issues 
@ dominos what is this, this is so unacceptable. 
when you order the hickory brisket and bacon burger minus the burger and it comes with the burger anyway but you can’t eat the burger because it’s not cooked inside. @

@ meghanmccain i watch #theview but they don’t let you explain why we voted for trump. i watch because of you, however they don’t let you talk. it’s so basis this is why trump won and will again. the left doesn’t care about anyone that supports trump. #nationdevided 
shep you do realize that you just insulted every person who voted for and/or supports our president, right? when is that ever okay? i guess all the “be nice and kind” and “take the high road” stuff you always say on the show was fake lip service? #southerncharm 
kingdom wasn't as good as i thought it would be òwó — nooooooo, did u read the manga, am sure u just thrown this shit away …

so is @ elonmusk a super villain? or just an evil genius? hard to believe that the same man who wants to fight climate change and help puerto rico gain access to solar power would make this donation. … 
apparently elon musk is a top donor for the republican party, yikes. what happened to giving a shit about the planet? #elonexposed 
part of that was royer not hustling back to cover his man on back post.

@ buildabear appreciate the gesture offering the 15 voucher.however my son is 8 & loves pokémon which cost around $30 each.even with the $15 we ‘saved’,we ended up spending $60 not $16.thus ended up losing $44 in savings.makes me wonder if we should shop you again. 
@ volcano_vap you have the most disappointing and least understanding customer support ever! refused to help, after 3rd faulty device. so disappointed, from a company i heavily recommended. #feelingthepain 
correction. the wait lasted more than two hours. i have stayed in quite a lot of hotels, but never experienced such wait and disregard for a guest. 
scattered fans for tonight’s game. wish more kingsport folks would support this team. #luckytohaveminorleagueteam #whereisthesupport 
just because your pain is understandable doesn't mean your behavior is acceptable 
@ dominos >>> @ topperspizza. toppers tried to offer a better deal than dominos 50% off, and tried to call them out. so i tried them the other night... instead of spending money on your social media, maybe invest in better product 
@ elonmusk really? how the “socially liberal” billionaire vowing to fight climate change could support the gop’s platform. the future with your technology are you planning to use coal? or just complicit like the others? #resist … 
after seen like 4off model 3 #tesla on the streets, don't know why so many people want them, the design lacks of aesthetic, not a pretty car. what a boomer, #expectations too high i guess

@ ikeauk was under the impression that ikea family card entitled the holder to free tea &coffee. why when i got cake & 2 coffees with card today i was charged £3.95, thiught that was an expensive piece of cake until got back to table and checked? #confused #misled 
ugh. i’ve been going to ucf ladies night for years. but this does not sound like something i will do.

having status with amtrak is worthless.. as a select plus member, they don’t let you board early or even have a dedicated line for loyal customers who ride the train weekly. fix the system in penn station #fixthesystem @ amtraknec @ amtrak

with the developer of #ngxcarplay ! waited so long for a #jailbreak and all this does on ios 11 is mirror your screen! looks like i’ll be buying #carbridge 
your products are already expensive, & i don’t mind paying it, but i expect to get what i paid for. this really makes me want to stop buying anything from you, since this is not the first time this has happened. @ starbucks (3/3) #starbucks 
the core group was fantastic the olivia munn direction of season 2 was a deal breaker .too much cia female agent story line not enough seal story line. know she has a name but we didn't watch for that we watched for the original cast 
@ bknight9 really bk. u have been on the fire matheny bandwagon longer than anybody i know and not 1 tweet about. was expecting fireworks from ur twitter handle. #so

@ amazon @ amazonhelp i just want to say i was all excited for prime day but every time i go in all i get is something went wrong #primeday 
i agree on some things, but he shouldn’t have questioned our fbi or spoke about the “witch hunt” or several other comments that did not belong on that platform. he left france strong /landed in #helsinki feeble and weak. #sadday 
@ amazon can’t handle all the #primeday traffic #frustrated 
deadlifts were trash. 
why don't your flyer prices match your actual prices? 
@ amazon what’s the point of being a prime member if your site keeps crashing? i just want the instapot deal but i can’t add it to my cart. #disappointed. 
@ hillsboroughgop where did your q post go? we were finally making some progress... 
@ suavecitopomade we will no longer be promoting or selling your product in our shop. you should really support the people who built your business up. #supportlocalbusiness 
@ charleys 
did @ amazon bite off more than it could chew?? 
also @ delta flight 1830 when we made this case to the flight attendant, rather than apologize and empathize, she argued & was rude--repeating the "rule" that gave priority to people who push the carry on baggage limits and don't pay to have it checked. #dissatisfied 
#primeday. adult equivalent of build a bear fiasco. #noinstantpotforme 
in you @ trish_regan !!!! 
seriously, as a buyer you're going to sit there and say purchase and not procure? #smh

ups the ups store how does one forget to put a package, that i paid a premium to be delivered next day, onto a shipping truck ? isn't that your core business model? #refund #disappointedson... … 
@ chipotletweets is there a way to complain about one of your stores? the one in mishawaka, in is pretty trash on service and everyone who worked there looks and acts like they don’t want to be there. on top of that the serving time is historically slow. 
i am a person that orders from amazon at least once a week. i feel like it’s christmas when packages arrive., but i am not excited about these prime deals maybe i am just not in market for what most people are #amazonprimeday 
@ optimumhelp something must have happened with the cable from the pole to the house; but since i’m the only one tech can’t come for two days? unacceptable. i work from home. #poorservice

@ tartecosmetics jeez how long does it take to process an order. it’s been 5 days and it hasn’t even been shipped 
@ elonmusk i used to really admire you. but you’ve shown yourself to be a narcissistic asshole, hypeman and con artist.

really! it froze in scene 12. 
@ yardhouse i tried the chicken fingers last night without being warned about the change in the recipe and they were absolutely terrible. yardhouse went from having the best chicken fingers i've ever had to the worst chicken fingers i've ever had.

how are @ british_airways going to cope with all the claims for accommodation from people that they have displaced this evening? i presume they will just assume that most won't bother. but a room at £300 and a flight at over £300 means that i most certainly will be! 
mamahood called and had to ditch out on #aim2018 30 minuets in so missed out on meeting @ sf28430 so will have to settle for podcasts #nexttime

@ wemocares when you click on “update” to upgrade firmware, nothing happens. app just returns to settings screen. what’s going on? you shouldn’t announce releasing a feature if it’s not really available. #betransparent

@ ikeausa horrible experience in columbus, ohio. they close at 9 but all the food was closed at 6. there are only 6 of the 26 registers open with 40-50 people in each. people have been so unfriendly. we live close by and love coming but today was rough.

@ hcjustinn @ guudelp about missed opportunities... think of the beautiful boy you could have made together!!

this trip back to our home town is making me realize how repetitive and how bad radio stations are anymore. 
tried to “eat mor chikin” at the @ chickfila near my house. at 4 o’clock on a saturday they’re “out of chicken nuggets”. i’m sorry...what? isn’t this what you do? #wheresmynuggets

what a crock of shit @ nbcsports putting a program on a channel that’s primarily used every couple years. rather be watching rugby. 
@ tacobell usually your shredded chicken mini quesadillas are a hot, melty-cheese meal. tonight i don’t think the workers even tried to heat mine up. the cheese wasn’t even melted. 
i'm a little behind on the @ flipsidepod, but @ bpmoritz, you just compared canadian to bud light and your takes are no longer valid. #lol 
@ starbucks in copenhagen dk you’ve failed me again. i keep hoping you’ll supply honey for my chai teas. but no! that was the last time for me. i’m in u. that’s all...

@ powerairfryer i have an xl air fryer with code e1 and was told that i need to ship it back to be repaired. terrible customer service. not provided realistic option to ship back.used a few times and it stopped working with no assistance from your customer service. 
disappointed in some of my fellow vets at the vfw convention booing the press. many fought and died so that we could live in a society with a free press. some of you guys would rather side with a draft dodger?

@ tacobell wow! this is a chicken burrito? hopefully next time i get the rice and chicken that i paid for. 
we are disappointed at the local governmental entity. to the naked eye and ear, you can clearly tell the dog being hit w the plastic bat as training was distressed. he yelped and tried to get away from the trainer. laws must change. … 
finally finished #beforethestorm.... i don’t get all the fuss. i mean, it was well written, the characters were good, but just wasn’t at all exciting or go anywhere. 
and then when i finally get a call from @ southwestair’s denver office it’s at 4:30 am! i hope nothing is ruined. thanks for making it abundantly clear that you’re a giant #corporation and your customers are just dollar signs who don’t matter. 
i honestly wish they just continue from where the old charmed left it, and used their kids for the reboot …

okay, @ dairyqueen, when i pay over five bucks for a watermelon lemonade, i'm not really gunning for a cup of plain soda water with a tiny slice of unripe lemon and a pinch of watermelon flavour on the bottom that is gone after the first three sips. #fivebucksforthis 
terribly unbalanced description. whole point is sides disagree on what care is. when agree there’s no issue, but some things called care seen as untested mutilations / brutal murder by others, not “care“. ok to disagree but you took sides instead. you can do better. 
it was a fantastic show! 
dan and i went to one of our favorite hangouts for dinner #logansroadhouse waxahachie because they were out of all wines and some other drinks! #coolerempty!!!

that's sad. every time the same thing happens with movies. you told us you would try to not change anything, but the piercings; no. this difference along with the tattoos were what kept me interested in this book

@ garmin why doesn’t livetrack work with facebook anymore? that was a great feature 
got to say i’m very disappointed in the facilities in camping plus at @ campbestival! reduced amount of toilets with no paper anytime i go. replaced the proper toilets with more porta loos! less showers! exactly what is the extra £150 for this year. #neveragain

i never get shown any pictures like that . #outoftheloop

could understand if it was the beginning of september... lots of people out holiday shopping today, myself included... doesn't make any sense 
@ uopxstadium @ azcardinals the only place that i saw any signage of the sort was at the gate entrance, which is great! but had there been signage in the parking lot, i would be in the stadium & not sending these messages to you. 
@ nespressousa you all of a sudden closed down your store at the @ farmersmarketla so i drove all the way to your “flagship store” and there’s a #ratinfestation so it was closed too.

@ crimminds_cbs still think agrnt hotchner deserved better. a better way to leave, a climax end to his departure, hell just a respectful conclusion. for most seasons he was the unflintching face of justice. a modern batman, in the fbi. he was the leader. 
@ julieplec @ thecw @ cwlegacies after the awful ending of to! i’m not going to continue the mikaelson story .... the originals deserved a better ending #klaus #elijahmikaelson #theoriginals 
if @ arvindkejriwal doesn’t course correct in punjab and if @ sukhpalkhaira quits politics. i will support even worse candidate of akali dal rather that supporting @ aappunjab led by stooges like @ aapbalbir @ avtar_badesha @ ipathak25 @ sanjayazadsln @ bhagwantmann

@ troybilt this pressure washer is terrible! worked fine out of the box for an hour light duty. wouldn't start 2 months later had to drain fuel line. stored it clean and drained. won't start again after 2 months. 
really sad that some adults in little league sports are willing to win at all costs, and in the process not care at all about the kids that they are coaching. or what they are teaching these kids. #getalife #notallaboutyou

@ moviepass please quit stepping on your own feet with the limitations on this new 3 movies a month thing. i love movie pass and go see movies constantly but it’s jumping through hoops anymore and not worth the hassle for you to sell people’s habits/ anon data.

@ arimelber @ thebeatwithari what else did you expect having @ realcandaceo on? if you truly wanted to have a two-sided discussion on race, your choice was just illogical. it’s like asking trump on to discuss truth. #disappointed. #thebeat #msnbc

after a long time, i'm again disappointed by @ indigo6e. their website says laptop bag is not charged as part of weight allowance, yet the counter team says the 7 kgs includes laptop. i end up paying excess baggage 
i didnt gain any followers from this.

@ lornajaneactive (2 of 2) i get that you can change your rules, but at least grandfather the people in who were already part of the program. this act shows u have no appreciation for loyal customers.

@ neppodcast should we be expecting a ‘real’ nintendo direct sometime soon detailing online subscription and other ‘new’ game announcements like nintendo said at e3? who is really going to be listening to video game tracks when you have itunes on your phone? 
it should be more than consideration. if my books arrive with damaged covers and torn pages. i’m going to be very upset. as a consumer i don’t want plastic housing my valued items. and i very much so value my books! this shouldn’t have to even be a discussion.

sadly buzz, hero that you are, i have to unfollow you for supporting the narrow, short-term, ill-thought through sentiment behind #spaceforce. how can a true explorer get behind the nationalist ravings of an internationally derided madman? 
@ delta first time purchasing a delta one seat. #1064 not impressed; kinda dirty! #notworthit

you think you know a person. next time, double check. 
michael, you need to accept that this is how it works. when you’re fresh out of the gate say we that want experience are “kidding ourselves”, and that’s your opening line...people won’t like it. they won’t like you. and now...they don’t trust you. 
@ frankienbennys absolutely rubbish service at your #colchester restaurant this evening, rude waiting staff, waited 40 mins from starters being cleared to get our mains. didn’t bother with desert as so late. won’t be back in a hurry 
sweet, thanks. maybe since you oversold the festival this year, instead of 2, you could put a water station near every stage? wouldn’t help your water sales, but probably better for your patrons. thanks! #outsidelands2018

her being called #dog has nothing to do with race. it has everything to do with her deceitful character … 
@ keselowski just got into town, went to walmart saw you were here stood in line only to be told we couldn’t even take your picture because we didn’t have wristbands. 
@ davidmuir no mention of the 41st anniversary of the king of rock & rolls passing?!?!?!!! #elvis 
@ claytoneighter came to creep on your twitter to see if you posted a picture of your tattoo and failed. 
@ panerabread i received my order today and it was incorrect and had huge chunks of chicken in a sandwich 
it’s no throne at all. @ vgunvalson is the only one who’s out of control on that whole strange, artificial power trip. until this year, you’ve been one of my favs - we have x-connections only by acquaintances but everything about you has been nice. 
2 months later and still no reply at all from @ stevemadden #poorcustomerservice … 
@ burgerking how does an order show up correctly on screen but still get made wrong? i asked for cheese and they forgot that and ketchup. i could get the same service at mcdonald’s and save a few bucks. 
filipino marries if momoland going somewhere around in manila please give them a space to enjoy their stay here and hopefully not repeat what happened at the airport yesterday. 
i am a huge @ bigbrotherus fan but i cannot continue watching this season. i really tried to get into it but i find this season incredibly boring. i hope next season will be better. 
where is the scarf?? 
when @ samheughan canceled they gave us 3 cast as a replacement, when @ caitrionambalfe canceled they only gave one 1 replacement cast. #sexist 
love you ari-but tonight is a pass. bannon is irrelevant and needs to stay that way. 
there are very few people whose intentions are pure, distinguish well. #personaldevelopment 
@ lawrence why are you letting @ arimelber give @ stevebannonwh45 free airtime to spread hate? #weexpectmore 
how did my all time favorite daytime drama suddenly get so boring? … 
smh i thought u were a movie buff 
@ michaelavenatti, why did ms. daniels cancel on cbb uk? they set the entirety of the show around her, title and all and she cancels hours before the live launch? #teamstormy #basta 
don't think i'm meant to get a new #macbookpro. after 2 brand new ones that arrived doa, i finally drove across town to the #applestore. they didn't have the newest macbookpro in stock. what? #stillatsquareone 
when you relied on @ ntelng @ ntelcare network to rescue naija from internet & it's the other way round in less than 3yrs. #bigshame 
no zlatan though . 
@ arimelber faithful viewer of yours and @ lawrence o’donnell, but i will not watch you give steve bannon a platform. he needs to crawl back under his rock. 
hugely by @ askamex @ amexuk i have the card to use airport lounges. #checkthesmallprint 
so .. only people that can afford $300-500 for a night for an adult & an 8 year old can only enter? seems about right for this company. way to get new people into your community. a+ for keeping it elite. #notaffordable #absurd 
i made the whole bar listen to electronic today. 
grabbed a box of @ paniniamerica crown royale today and was pumped to finally pull a tatum auto card! until i saw the mis-sig that ruins the card . how’d they let this slide? #panini #tatum #basketballcards 
this sounds like hippie shit, myrna. 
@ arimelber cannot watch this man who is against a everything america stand for. why? you gave so many good people to interview. 
@ chickfila i ordered 2 medium fries and didn’t notice until i got home that i only received 1 fry. 
i don’t care how much you love @ whereslloyd do not order anything @ newerafield. not worth the $12 #otr2 
so, can you call something “yoghurt” just because you’ve added probiotic cultures to it? this looks and tastes exactly like the coconut cream from which is was made. not sure what i expected. #fellforthehype 
… i was with the #lucario #movie but this one is #great! 
my understanding is they won't be using it this year. sorry. 
@ adamhillscomedy #expectedbetter #bullshit 
@ chipotletweets this is so embarrassing for you guys... i don’t remember ordering 1/2 of a bouritto bowl with 4 pieces of lettuce, but i sure did pay full price for the take out order.... 
@ scotrail hideous train journey this evening. unsafe numbers travelling from edinburgh. 15 of us in the small vestibule area by the door with condensation running down the walls because of the heat. i was foolish enough to pay for this? #unsafe 
federal cabinet looking more like ex pml-q, ppp, pml-n, mqm and gda. where is pti's cabinet? why shafqat mehmood and shireen mazari are given non sense ministries? where is ali zaidi, ali muhammad khan, zartaj gul, murad saeed? #pti #primeministerimrankhan 
@ deltaairlineus why would i book more flights? 
@ mcdonaldsuk food from newton aycliffe branch.. £16 spent, 2 items missing.. fries and mozzarella dippers.. kind of them to put the sauce in though #poorservice #mcdonaldsnewtonaycliffe #mcdonalds 
@ braves should have done 40,000 instead of 20,000 for a night this big. so many people just showing up and leaving with them while loyal fans sit in the rain empty handed 
thank you, @ costco for refunding what we paid for our year membership to @ moviepass. it was great at first, but now they only let you see movies that no one wants to watch. total waste. i think i’ll check out the @ cinemark movie club instead! 
@ thelastleg you can't use words like 'cult' when millions of people see hope in 1man over the people you constantly ridicule #onyourlastleg #jc4pm #hesnotthemessiahbutyouraverynaughtyboy … via @ digitalspy 
blocked by @ ogkevingill and i don’t remember even interacting with him once. the hate is strong with this one. #snowflake #antipma 
just got this.. waited for 2 months but this is how @ popinabox sent my pop.. 
our situation was resolved but your direct message team did not respond to our last inquiries plus whatsapp and messenger which are supposed to be 24/7 did not read our messages still. #klm @ klm 
@ harlemweek y’all need to do better next year.y’all had us waiting for 2 hrs past @ janetjackson ‘s appearance time & we only hear her speak for 1min. save all the dancing, awards,etc.until after esp. if it’s raining! not a great harlem week for my 1st time attending. 
no shit???? and here i thought he might go live in one of his ideal communist societies and let us rebuild our economy and society without him! 
@ fiveguys when i walk into a five guys, i expect it to taste like five guys. the one in orem,ut tastes like overpriced mcdonald's 
@ waltdisneyco i have girls who love the avengers. how come your @ disney stores only carry boy’s t-shirts?!? #childrenequality 
i watched that entire match just to see ambrose turn heel #summerslam 
omg i just left the theater shaking i knew it was bad political corruption i didn't know how far it has become now i know who so far has been and could be bought by treacherous corps or individuals #followthemoney #savedemocracy 
@ outback well hopefully this is a mistake but just paid almoat $10 for a small order of cheese fries...there are less fries here than im my kids side from the joey menu. i order them all the time and this is never what i have gotten. very disappointing 
being a @ wwe fan for over 25 years, it’s sad to see how lazy they’ve become with setting up the stages for the 4 major ppvs. it seems as if all i am watching now is a glorified version of raw. #summerslam #wwe 
the ⁦ @ comfortinnyyj⁩ in st. catharines ontario canada did not include a free breakfast. 
hey @ mcdonalds - if you’re going to freshly make your burgers, make sure they are actually cooked. #itsstillmooing 
what's going @ espn. no control in a game with kids and kids watching. … 
@ lays where’s the pickle and ranch? i ordered these and waited for over a month, and they taste like plain potato chips. 
i’m so frustrated with @ nespressousa for building a beautiful new store in #indianapolis but only selling vertuoline in it. i as a faithful owner of my originalline will not receive the same experience as others. #frustrated 
my mom got very excited when one of my pics got a like from adele. she fought it was the real @ adele but it wasn’t. she’s gutted now #westie #zshq 
@ justeatuk wasted my night, after two hours and 3 chats later i had to get the refund myself for two rancid pizzas. absolutely ridiculous, been a loyal customer for years and today the app gets deleted. ubereats and deliveroo 100% better in their process and service 
@ mcdonalds thanks for having diet coke as the only diet option. no more coke zero or diet dr pepper.... 
the dean of students said “we’re all in this together” and i’m really the only one who sang high school musical in my section 
@ culvers drive thru order wrong, not the best looking meat patty and just a smear of ketchup but still had excellent 
starting to lose respect for this show. im glad u guys stopped mcdonalds sauce trend, but to shut down a bar because these fans love you im startin to lose respect and so are many others im sure this and the waiting will have a major effect on ur raitings next year 
andrew, for the sake of canada, step aside. you've no credibility. you waited a week, you didn't defend mb when red rosie from the cbc associated him with charlottesville. you let your guy hang rather than defend his character. your words are hollow mr. scheer. 
@ sas wow..... your new and fancy website is hands down the most user unfriendly worthless experience i have have tried to navigate in years, impossible to book any kind of ticket with flexibility #bad #unfriendly #nocustomerservice 
massive oversight by the @ afl by not getting humphrey b. bear to consult on rule changes 
@ pokemongoapp. so a gym in poor area was removed today and i had a pokemon there for 9+ hours before everything changed. my pokemon was returned to me full health but i received no coins. can i please have my 50 coins?! #rippedoff

it only took @ tuiuk 7 weeks to get our cases back from sal, after multiple chase emails, a whole new summer wardrobe & a 192km return trip to gatwick to get them ty @ theresortgroup for showing what real customer support is! #tui #customerexperience 
not impressed with the new avengers movie 
@ niantichelp my #researchreward's are broken. i have space for 4 and the top one goes to a blue screen. none of the research tacks count toward the main reward! #softwarebug #softwaretesting 
how come i retweeted like 5 of y’alls “rt or your worst week starts now” and i’m already having a horrible week???? 
@ fitbit @ fitbitsupport so you announce the forthcoming #fitbitcharge3 does it have the same design flaw as #fitbitcharge2 had mine for a little over a year and screen cracked top to bottom with no just reason. have seen lots of others complain about same issue 
i thought you were my huckleberry.... 
@ apple @ applesupport #badbusiness #apple after 2 phone calls (today for 53 minutes!), a genius bar visit, and them sending in my watch and told i was getting a repair and still nothing. i normally love apple and have tv, iphone, macbook but this is horrible service 
so i tried tinder for the first time. and all of my matches are pabebe. hindi uso sa akin ang submissive.

there is srsly something messed up with @ youtube . i have done everything that they've said and it doesn't get any better. first my videos can't play, now their is no audio. i even tried turning off and on the audio on my computer and the video. 
was just scammed by the @ apple trade in program. got a quote. sent in mac. mac was delivered. offer was drastically reduced. don’t use trade in programs that don’t keep their word. #phobioisascam @ applesupport @ gogophobio 
you are misusing the anthropomorphic word "laziness". a disservice to yourselves, your readers & science.

@ senatorcollins … 
to much concern can kill you 
you can say and do whatever you want. still doesn't change the fact by going to perform there, you won't be presenting any justice or equality whatsoever. i was saving money to collect all your albums, i can use that money for something else now. #lanadontgo 
i can see how you'd arrive at that conclusion, ai, so i'll give you a pass on the description. there are no free passes for bad grammar, though: haven't you been programmed to know when the indefinite article needs to be 'an' rather than 'a'? 
i love dateline, but really that headline 
@ leonsfurniture beyond disappointed with our sales experience and now my brand new dishwasher is a lemon...and no one can come out for 10 days to fix it?? passed around like just another number in the book. don’t recommend this store to anyone. outrageous. #leons 
someone tell me how the hell i got 4200 views on a tweet in 3 hours and not a single person liked it. smh you guys doing me dirty. #postmalone 
@ webjet_au my grandpa is dying and you can't change my mums flight without charging an extra 1.5k? and she can only get a refund in 16 weeks, he will be dead by then. where is your compassion? 
@ nandosuk picked up a takeaway from bury branch for my daughter & her friend. the sauces were not there so pretty much was an uneventful nandos meal . did try calling & was doing a return journey ... nandos + ketchup didn't really do it for them 
got one of those new subway wraps earlier today. like everything else fae there, it was a bit of a fucking rip off imo. 
why so little media coverage of #lacofd captain habell’s procession? 
wow jesse...and here we all thought he was the youtube boyfriend 
@ senatorcollins why do you keep falling for the lies? when will you truly put country over party. you’re a powerful woman - use your sword! #bluetsunami2018 …

i'm sick and tired of waiting for @ twitter to actually do something about my locked account.. that's why i've decided to create a backup. #pissed 
so @ lowes does it normally take a month and half (and counting) three damaged pieces and customers making phone calls to your vendors to get countertops installed ??? you might need to put that at up on the display. #ridiculousness #whatdidipayfor? 
@ natsparkservice very sad for my two boys. we arrived at 5:50 for @ katieledecky meet and greet and were turned away. the website said gates would close at 6:15. #falseadvertisement #sadswimmers

price tag is slightly high for this phone. it was launched 1st in abu dhabi 2 months ago. it should be priced 8999/-. it runs on mtk p23 (16nm, power consuming). @ realmemobiles has better option than this having mtk p60 (12nm, power efficient) in just 8999. 
@ airbnb doesn’t match discription so unhygienic we left yet not able to get a full refund #neveragain

@ walmart 7:30pm on a friday evening...typical site at the hagerstown, md walmart 1674. guess i will have to go elsewhere for milk, happens every time i go in this store. this time the deli was closed at 7:30 too! 
@ twitter these are the people you are allowing on ur family friendly app ? …

@ oliviamunn i really like your character in six. i hated that last episode !!!! 
was expecting that booza was slang for 
& the cute boy i love didnt invite me to his dorm yet 
i no longer watch fox prime time because it clearly bent towards trump (with the exception of @ shannonbream at 11 pm est). no longer fair and balanced.

@ waltdisneyworld just bought funnel cake and no chocolate sauce and hardly any ice cream so totally dry. not worth $9 
@ karren_brady read your article on domestic abuse/dan osbourne in @ thesun would expect a role model like yourself to have a less chauvinistic opinion.37% of victims are male.30% of fatalities are male.d/a against males is at its highest, and rising. 
saw the 99 cent promo. was going to get deadpool 2. promo was for sd. #disappointed. oh well it's 99 cents. surprise same thing happened like last time when @ redbox held this promo. can't complete transaction. #screwit. going to stick with @ google for ondemand movies.

bitch me too smh how dare they??? ugh so unoriginal???!!!! 
i really dislike this update. it doesn't accommodate bold text and the appearance is bland. all good things come to an end. 
wow.. i thought @ kendalljenner was the nice sister.. seems she is an entitled bitch like her sisters.. 
there’s no reason why i should be watching a commercial in the middle of a three min video. @ facebook 
would be a nice gesture but your dealing with a man who has little dignity! best friends with comey! a very small person! very difficult to believe that this man “served his country.” @ bobsmueller 
i am so pissed. i can not believe i just paid for cold food. thanks workers of @ tacobell. #coldfriessuck #coldtacosareacrime oh and seriously 4 packs of sauce. i use 3 on just one taco. 
i would say his image has taken a big hit this summer

where's the @ scottrogowsky bobblehead??? #hesmyquemeronumerouno 
beware the @ doubletree at london hyde park. terrible staff and a 20 minute phonecall to sort out erroneous credit charges cost me over £10 #ripoff #avoid #didntevengetawarmcookie 
it’s sad to leave this world with hate! is the fact that wanting to become a president didn’t come true made the hero in mccain an angry man! for the unfairness of an non-politician business man for being the people’s choice hard to bear! why? would he request this! 
that is honestly kind of nasty. trust me, i like a good, risque joke .... but seriously guys? 
dunkirk - i thought it was poor m8. didn’t do justice for the actions of the brave....

dear @ timhortons , how dare you get rid of your poutine!! it was one of your best dishes!!! 
well my truck was stolen last night from my mothers rental, been letting her use it to clean up her property where her house burnt down. this country really needs to change. prisons are full, the people lack the fear of punishment, and they don’t value life. 
why is it so difficult for men to notice when the woman in their lives changes her hair color/style? no, seriously ..they notice the tiniest little scratch/bump on the car but not the fact that you went from purple hair to black!? #marriage #relationships #smh

#hurt #fuckthem #hatersgonnahate … 
honestly yt is being a d-head to bts and armys and not being able to do anything about this is the worst feeling in the world. we deserve better. we use the platform everyday, watch the ads, some of us even invested money in yt red for bts and all we get is this.

issue seems to be with the indictment of current elites & system. u had the nuanced view about mccain 1 min before then read them as paper thin as rando right wingers is a bad look. you guys didn't even engage with the ideas. not mad just #badfaith #urbetterthanthat 
if only you were direct to the point & honest @ direkmike. it was a great opportunity for u to explain the delays or as an aldub fan, can i still exxpect anything from apt/ @ gmanetwork? you have a/m in the palm of your hands now but who knows about tomorrow.??

the bad decision about the pipeline will be the downfall of jt. i believed he had the courage to make decisions that are good for the planet in the long term, rather than bad for the environment & good for short-term votes in alberta …

@ whitesox #gameday not only were my nachos stale, but it looks like they gave me the bottom of the bag pieces. bf's pizza is ice cold. normally the food quality is very good. what happened?

some of our utility companies need to step up their game regarding how they treat their customers. it cannot be that the customer is the one who initiates the conversation regarding an update on a 'down' service. #consumerdemand

kingsley moghalu just lost me. can't stay true on the simple matter of consensus candidate, no way he can stay true on big national issues. he's starting to appear as one of the same old power grabbing pple we've always known.

@ pizzahutdeliver really poor delivery service...a cold pizza arrived 1hour 40 min after placing the order. the edgware road hut even stopped answering the calls. have never been so disappointed. complete waste of money and time. #poorservice #pizzahut 
can you please show the clip to the housemates now @ bbuk and clear poor @ ryanjamesthomas? it's unfair that other housemates now think he actually punched @roxannepallett like she says he has?! #teamryan what do u think @ scottyspecial ? 
when you attack the president you attack americans. you can call us trumpians all you want. we are americans and we are standing up for what is right in this country. seems to me your attack on the president that’s what started the feedback in the first place. 
@ stoolpresidente never do this..but huge mistake with @ patmcafeeshow. literally the only thing worth listening to on power85 other than your show. he was so good! 
#sadpoetry … 
well...i tried to go to the @ fqmarketyeg market today but it was more of a single soap vendor than a market. 
i guess that means we won’t be battling on the exterior of the empire state building while jack kirby sketches us? 
sorry @ publix for inconveniencing what must be the laziest butcher i've ever encountered. i'll get my meat @ freshmarket next time. – bei publix 
someone tried to fuck with me after i asked what they were doing later. he said "doing a bunch of drugs" to which i replied: "really? what kind? can you hook it up?" needless to say that i didnt get hooked up and he wasnt going to do drugs 
it’s a great dance show but i’m not sure it’d make much difference if a drag artist was wearing a #britney bikini tonight. not worth the money #lipsync #bored the rubbish photo matches my opinion btw 
nothing worse than finding something amazing on sale... getting it home and finding it's broken..doesn't work or don't fit..

i was just hassled by a @ sandiegopoliced officer patrolling mission point park about my service dog and he forced me to leave. 
@ cookout in high point nc this is a hot dog not the cheese fry that i ordered. 
took it to the engineer who confirmed my biggest fear. the laptop is totally gone with no hope of recovering my files either as the hard disk is also dead due to the impromptu incident. i feel like i was retrenched at work without due course. #pained and 
...and i was just typing on my @ samsung laptop on thursday, it went off all of a sudden and hasn't come back on since then even after several trial. i can't trace the reason as i have been very careful with it as freelance is my basic source of income. #pained and

@ realjerryjones cut the best kicker in the league but won’t fire jason garrett? wow 
@ kevinhart4real you looked like a high dork on @ jrossshow with your co-lead on the movie you were trying to promote. more worrying that some idiots thought you were hilarious. tiffany was worse. so unprofessional. #hideous

new launches glitches happen, it's expected but holy hell it took almost 11 hrs for @ boxycharm #boxyluxe box to even move past the confirm yr subscript to the waitlist. wtf.11hr frm confirming to error to waitlist, i try in again in dec? doubt it!! not worth it! 
why?? cannot believe he lives in the same household as me. 
i think i just have to accept this life how it is. 
this is toxic masculinity you're better than this, ose. 
hey @ timhortons maybe add "don't tell the customer they are wrong when they bring forth a complaint" to your training manual. thanks. #notthecanadianway 
the burden of being @ imvkohli. play a test match, if he doesnot score the runs, lose it, go to the post match press, praise the opposition for winning not exactly because they played better but his own team played so badly, come back & score runs & lose again. #hurt 
@ benandjerrysoz i'm still really upset that you guys didn't actually come out with the flavors mentioned in avengers: infinity war. #missedopportunity 
@ dynatrap, wife wanted me to pick up something to eliminate many flies in house. you were recommended. flies all over but only 5 captured overnight. any advice? 
so i made the mistake of buying a digital game from the @ playstation store today. played the game and really didn’t enjoy it. contacted @ piaystation_us and they said since i had downloaded and played the game they couldn’t give a refund. 
weird no one helicoptered me in for bid day this year @ ravincentvango 
@ mcdonaldsuk is this some kind of joke? i ask for no mayo so you smother it on a burger.... 
@ bjsrestaurants disappointed because i know my pizookie is supposed to come with two scoops of ice cream and not one. 
why is there no *picking my nose emoji*? 
@ nordstrom what happened to your customer service??? 
yes, the loss of a war hero who served this country. it's too bad that some felt the need to use the funeral to make political statements. 
@ immaculatebkng please rename your chocolate chunk cookies to speck chocolate cookies. a chip would be bigger than the chocolate in these. 
@ dominos_uk this is apparently extra cheese?? 
if anthopolous remained in charge of the #bluejays after they won the al east, he would have added to the team in order to win a world series. but we got atkins and shapiro, who have systematically dismantled the jays. god knows when they will be a top team again.

@ madisonsocial what’s the deal - we can’t bring out family in to get out of the rain because we have kids. #disappointed. 
was told that @ tacobell no longer sells beef burritos and that, as of today, nacho fries are gone again? is that true? 
nope. seth you lost me. there are _not_ two sides to listen to, or understand, or give legitimacy to when speaking of white supremacy or nazism or fascism. there’s only one side. free speech does *not* include hate speech. … 
@ cvgairport how is there no skyline chili here?! #queencityspecial 
if you are a waiter/waitress and i ask for mtn dew, and you respond with we have mellow yellow, i hate you. it’s not the same. 
i worked with cody at the colfax denver store. after spending hours in the store, not originally being asked what size gb i need for my phone, & restarting the restore & backup processes multiple times, i lost over 1700 media files. complete review on yelp. #tmobile 
sad day when you’re a @ 5sos fan at the concert but get treated like you’re too old. apparently over a certain age the fam wants me to give up my spot (tho i paid for my ticket) & the ushers want me in the parent section. #thismomrocks #nevertooold4goodmusic 
geez, never thought i'd live to see the day that lance storm was politicking for a higher spot on the card. 
when your @ amazon order turns up and it looks like this #fuming 
thanks to @ chickfila for making my daughter cry. you closed early without putting it in the app for my mobile order. it was what she was looking forward to after a long car ride (8 hr) back home. 
@ dominos ummmm-think this one is way too done!?! maybe @ pizzahut next 
@ boseuk @ bose very unimpressed with bose soundsport free earphones. expected better from bose. out of sync audio from videos and mono phone call audio is just not what i expected. they go back for a refund. #bose #poor 
highly disappointed by the kind of service provided by myntra. is this the kind of packaging you expect for premium products ordered online from a premium website. @ myntrasupport @ myntra #customer 
really @ innoutburger?! after waiting in line for 15 minutes for 2 neapolitan shakes and a cheeseburger animal style, you still could’t include a few napkins? you’re better than this! #nonapkins #innoutburger 
@ theo2 outrageous behaviour by your staff today when asked for assistance for my disabled sister who is in a wheelchair. staff were extremely unhelpul, a clear lack of customer service. #disgusted #appauled 
i have been trying to find #cornsoup & #bakenshark on the parkway and caan find it. 
@ lifeproof for how expensive your phone cases are they shouldn't be falling apart within such a short amount of time & little wear & tear. #neveragain 
steve bannon - seriously, why is everyone selling their souls for so little these days?!? every now and then you think a particular group/person/company is above such cheap tricks. then the new yorker does this. i guess everyone does have a price. #sadday 
you cost us chris edwards. we had them. they talked about cutting down penalties. you forget? 
you'd leave out post-modernists and countless varieties of marxist? 
@ nike a man who wears this dipicting cops as pigs is your ad guy? what about our families of officers? what about families of those who died due to this fradulant attack on them? #mydadmattered #officersmatter 
i thought you were zulu...wow 
i just had a kid around the age of 10 who was fully capable of riding a hover board ask me how much longer to halloween. so you can ride a hover board but aren't able to determine how far away halloween is kids today need to get their priorities straight. 
so was waiting for the bus from 23:15 and after the bus was late. and spent 30 mins untill nearly everyone was aboard we was told two people could not get on. i’m cold and on the pavement waiting for the 02:00 bus. @ flyswfalcon how do i get a refund?

i thought you were getting picked no offense but colton would get stuck in a revolving door because he can’t figure out if he’s coming in or going out *facepalm* you got some old school, man class that would have been refreshing to see #bachelor 
@ fragrantjewels i'm a little in my "purrfect" #bathbomb. it looks nothing like the one advertised on your site and the plastic wrapping around the one delivered to me has been cut in 2 spots by (what looks like) a box cutter. maybe from when lot shipment was 
@ planetfitness manager “can’t promise” a trainer will really show up to friday’s scheduled class after 3 weeks of no call/no shows. and apologized with a sigh when told this was on the floor in a dressing room for over 24 hours. am i expecting too much? 
took a flight from bwi to msp last night on @ delta and my seat cushion was loose and husbands entertainment system not working. we have a long haul coming up, hope this doesn’t happen on those flights! 
@ whitecastle this is double cheese? #wheresthecheese 
@ amazonhelp 2nd time in a week this has happened with two separate orders. so much for being a prime member and receiving next day delivery!

sitting in the @ getspectrum store in #noho with a full store of customers and only half the registers in operation. very #smh 
@ nbcnightlynews (longtime viewer) — sad to see you bash the @ potus every night .. never showing the + (extremely biased reporting); also sad to see that you are also an ‘arm’ of the democratic (radical left) party (agenda). #notobjective 
day three without a cell phone thanks to @ samsungmobileus @ samsungmobile locked me out of my account and can't figure out how to make it right. i used to love my galaxy note. now i can't trust the company any longer. #worstcustomerservice #letdownbycorporate 
so, i'm nuking my dinner because the instant pot just didn't get it hot enough. you'd think that 15 minutes would be enough to reheat food from the refrigerator. 
telling other's story to save your relationship is so dreadful. to the highest level.. 
@ duracell very disappointed that my ultra group 31 heavy duty fleet battery failed after 25 months because i expected more from a duracell. that’s why i chose it to put in my wife’s car. #fail 
when did @ paniniamerica change their redemption policy on expired cards? this is highly disappointing as i had a patch auto /99 from 13/14 dominion hockey that was never produced that i can "replace" for a measly 150 rewards points. 
anyone know how to get in touch with owners of @ mvkeywest as the gm & staff were not very helpful. dm me! #havepictureswillpost #customerservice #brand 
@ qatarairways for flights via the us, you need to know that a 2hr layover is not enough to pick up baggage and drop them off for recheck in! missed my flight to @ toronto coz of that and been stuck @ chicagoairport for the past 2hrs & my flight keeps getting delayed! 
you’ve never dipped your fries into a @ wendys frosty? 
sometimes i wish i could stop expecting getting treated the same way i treat people. it’s sad, and very disappointing when you can treat someone with so much respect, and they feel it’s okay treat you like shit! #people #life #humanity

hey @ europcar it’s me again. it’s been 42 days since my first enquiry into the overcharge of €133.06 i only mention this amount as that’s the amount of money it’s cost you to lose a customer. please don’t reply as i’ve now passed the onto my bank @ visa to resolve 
the ability to swap legacy mons for guaranteed lucky’s would have been amazing too...

as a kid i’d read of lodestones being used for compasses , so i always assumed “lode” had to do with magnetism, but now i’m discovering it’s more about navigating to the north (star) and less about magnets 
to see @ monzo exchange rates are worst than local venues. went to a resultant that gave me the option to pay £23 gbp or 118 pln & i chose pln (as i always do with cash machines as well) however this time i was wrong & was charged higher than of monzo

was watching the @ joerogan podcast, thinking how great it was that the us had come so far in the right direction on drugs that elon musk taking a hit was now acceptable. an hour later i looked at the news... 
truly wished jamaica's politics would have been elevated from where it once was. joan gordon webley walked right by the pm to go on stage and acknowledged everyone else except the pm and mp. we need to grow up 
laura loomer, you interrupting that meeting, shows just what kind of unprofessional journalists you are. even if i like what you are standing for. there is a time and a place. showing respect gets more of the right attention. 
@ iamcardib when that maternal instinct kicks in......people don't play bout their kids...not cool @ nickiminaj 
to those who made the deal to not have @ england games on @ bbc or @ itvfootball...congrats on alienating the support of many who can't afford subscription t.v. and there we were getting excited about a fresh start 
my mom just did a full 180 in the car to punch me in the leg because she saw a yellow car...i’ve taught her too much. 
1st terrible @ airbnb situation. owner misrepresented unit, got mansplain-aggressive, then wrote review of me w/easily refutable lies. i tried to work directly w/ both to correct issues instead of writing bad review. airbnb’s response so far: you are a chump. 
someone in my office highly recommended this movie. i’m halfway through and i haven’t even seen batman let alone heath ledger as the joker.

this is what happens when the cashier bags yogurt on the bottom of a bag with weight on top. @ target it’s a waste of time and money to go back to return or buy another. 
wow montel. never thought i'd hear you speak like this to an american hero. 
i went to @ subway today and it was a hot mess! won't be returning. i'm sure it won't be long until jersey mike's and jimmy john's put them out of business. 
for #australia psychic reading client: energetically your close friendship has been influenced by the woman i was tuning into. the dynamics have changed dramatically. it is hard to lose close friendships you have developed over many years. 
my family has had season tickets for 20+ years but never has any @ penguins players come to my house to deliver our season tickets. 
just found out none of us got m&g for @ metallica again. snubbed every time. it's not like they come to #southdakota very often. sad that only people with money get in, but not necessarily the true fans. yet again. 
thanks @ espn for not airing @ eminem at the coin toss. i wasn't looking forward to it all day or anything... #jets #detroitlions

major @ hellofresh flop today, and for tomorrow, as well. thank goodness i always keep a backup dinner on hand, but that means i have to shop a day earlier than planned, too. 
what the heck @ twentyonepilots, not even one canadian tour date on the list? 
#cbbbots why feed into the ganging up of housemates against hardeep #theshowisover 
when @ adelaidetbirds haven’t even sent a message to fans to reassure them and you finally realise why this club is viewed the way it is 
maybe save time and just tweet when it's in service? #yeg 
why would you believe this hogwash put out by ? we were just starting to take you seriously! 
@ siriusxm i finally purchased a package on saturday and have been resending signals ever since! #unhappy #hellllp!! 
imagine how far that $1 million could have gone on other initiatives? or towards better bus service itself? 
not enamored #stormname but then again, i hope we don't get to hear about many of them this … 
@ united next time there are flight delays please feel free to text me notifications on the phone number entered into the system! not a great first impression. ua2327 
@ beefobrady please tell me why i paid $11.99 for this sad grilled chicken salad from my local beef o’brady’s?!?! i should’ve just made my own version of it for $5 at home. 
@ bflay why does my milkshake look absolutely nothing like the advertised pic and also why does my milkshake taste horrible? #flayforall 
i don’t know why @ gabe_casmus doesn’t speak spanish back to me. 
@ starbucks went out of my way to get a starbucks coffee in brentwood tn, only to get to my meeting and have my coffee be wrong not even close to correct and taste nasty! if you are a coffee person you know that the wrong coffee has the potential to ruin your day 
sooo for those of us that understand the sheer amount of marvel properties that do in fact prove his statement wrong get to ask...why can't you google it kit? or even ask siri...i'm sure you can manage one of those. #fail 
you know what i been loyal to @ geico & it ticks me off they won’t help one of their loyal customers who ran into some struggle & im not even asking for a lot! the greed is real ! #thanksfornothing #thisisshitty 
@ tuiuk you clearly are not monitoring your calls, emails or tweets. bet if i were to book another holiday i would get a speedy response! #stillnoresponse 
oh nah you’ve been condemned honey, 
i just bought it day before and i repeat again but disappointed not to see a headphones/earphones with the box and moreover the price in the uk for the base model was a bit steep compared to other markets as well.. #disappointing 
i typically don’t fly @ united , so i don’t know if this is typical. booked my flight, picked my seat, paid my price. checked in to the flight today and my seat was changed from an aisle to a middle. #nexttimeillfly #delta 
no stream tonight. i had the internet fixed and now it’s back out. someone is supposed to be here later today to try an fix it again. sorry @ spectrum trash customer service and techs! i pay you for one thing and you fail at that! yay 
let down by @ cacradicalgrace had problems registering for a course so emailed cac same day. heard nothing for a week. i emailed again and was told i was too late to register. no apology for ignoring first email. sorry @ richardrohrofm 
this sort of behaviour should not have to be tolerated … 
@ arbys i didn't realize a regular roast beef sandwich came with a burnt bun and cheese. this isn't edible. @ 
why the notch @ apple ? . i wouldve bought the new iphones if the notch is no longer there. #newiphone2018 
wow @ phillyd if you had something to say to me, you could’ve just said it to my face like a real man 
@ 99restaurants sad to say on my first visit here i’m highly disappointed. not only did we never receive the appetizer we ordered. my food allergy wasn’t taken into account in the kitchen. when the matter was discussed with the manager we were completely dismissed. 
a sad morning pilipinas.... #sadbuttrueimwalkingaway #discouraged — feeling disappointed 
go to allsups for damn bean and beef burrito and the worker gave me chimichangas smh. #stillgonnaeatthem #thisiswhyidrink 
and all these negative responses is why we will be single. people are jerks. it’s free to fucking show love and compassion. #foreversingle #peoplesuck 
but why so many lawmakers vote yes, even democrats? seemed like a simple no vote after you gave that speech. 
and that’s exactly what i said about the iphone 8 last year before i found myself waking up at 3 am to order the phone i’m using today ... at myself 
the iphone xs max is dumb af , i’m not buying it, there is no purpose for me to get it ... 
you never even brought up biking during a blizzard. 
so it took me 20 minutes to order a pair of trainers because @ adidasuk don’t know how to work a website 
just cut your losses and get out at this point @ wbpictures … 
the nun is a joke 
echoing your statement! #onpoli 
received my iphonex without a tray. waiting so long for 32 minutes only to get disconnected. i’ve been rerouted to many other areas to be told that the next person will help me! no one is prepared to send me a new tray, despite the fact that i also bought 
apart from a bigger screen there’s no real reason to upgrade x no nfc. no fast charger. no fast file transfer (old to new), no free cloud storage (eg 200gb)! it’s like you’ve got writers block. take a holiday & get back to innovating! … 
but if i do it now i’ll have to make up £100-£200 difference or wait a month and do it for free. you would think as everyone who got an iphone x on refresh is in this position you would allow free upgrades a month early to coincide with the new iphone release. 
sorry @ nbcworldofdance i think you got it wrong. @ michaeldameski should have taken the win. #worldofdance 
why haven’t you already found him!? 
absolutely one of the worst customer service experiences ever. come on @ potterybarn value the customer!! … 
and, again, a big yes to @ jrubinblogger. what was the point of all you did, senator, if you won't walk the walk? … 
@ lin_manuel my daughter is 11 and she's obsessed with your play. its all she ever talks about since the mock play at her school. i want to take her to see the real play but its very expensive. 
my cat is never as excited to see me as i am to see her. 
@ justin_biegel very poor showing from ac students 
got my first grade under a 100 in chinese which was a 95 
sad that ottawa wanted karlsson gone so bad that they pretty much let san jose have him. 
when there aren't any targets in your sector during the lfx 
omg. @ morris_oxford what were you doing driving your car in that london? 
no rose gold option is enough to make me not want to upgrade my iphone @ apple 
@ tiffanyandco i’m on vacation and my cleaning cloth is not cleaning my silver bracelet. went into your las vegas store to see if the could quickly clean it. nope, 3 days and i’d have to leave it? no thanks. time to step up your customer service. 
ya, that's cool and all, but you can bring up super smash bros, announce one character, and then end the talk about super smash bros when the character wasn't even that cool. 
me after watching the nintendo direct just now #nintendodirect #nintendoswitch #nogames 
hey @ mcalistersdeli, your portion size has dramatically decreased. not sure how you serve a place of ultimate nachos half empty. #disappointed. 
@ lootcrate 
just received the worst customer service of my entire life. rogers needs to reevaluate their whole system and give their agents a training on how to talk to customers. #rogers 
why no batman: under the red hood on this list. … 
individual dancers on your show will never win. michael so deserved to win. stop giving scores based on sentiment. the lab should not have won. two seasons in a row the wrong person has won. #worldofdance 
when you try to save time and order your @ tacobell online but your order is late (and wrong) and your power bowl is definitely not powerful where are the damned beans?! 
@ united i am with my son @ justin_jmo on this journey to #greenbay and it’s not good. delay causing extra unnecessary expense 
never tell someone taking pills for their mental illness is unhealthy. 
the mini heatwave promised by the @ metoffice seems to becoming colder and colder now for tuesday #weatherwatch 
what a joke @ burgerking last time i got no tomatoes and now i got the pieces no one wants to eat. i asked for extra tomato. 
i don't really like eminem's new rap style. i needed more. 
@ challengemtv i was a new fan until ct and @ tori_deal were sent home from africa. #overit #theymaketheshowworthwatching 
the final performance of the lab was really weak. it didn’t deserve the score at all! what was neyo thinking?? michael was waaaaay superior! #disappointed! it ruined the whole season for me!

oh really? i totally thought he’d just up and confess straight up. #shocked 
@ tomssupport i gotta say – this latest promotion is quite disappointing. tbf i didn't order shoes for the $20 promo, but to find out that i have only 20 days to use the coupon is asking too much of your patrons. it just comes off as petty and inconsiderate. 
@ easyjet can’t believe we had x2 flights cancelled back in june due to french atc, sent off our claim, still no response and we’re now into september 
@ jolly_rancher only one green apple in the whole pack!!! 
@ tacobell drove all the way to you guys just to get told you don’t sell fries anymore. 
@ mdlz i had really high hopes for these but like, what are they? is it a snack? a cereal? cat food? #letdown 
this @ lagalaxy defense is just hot garbage. obviously money can’t buy a good defense. 
as the @ fbi has lost so much credibility i’m somewhat surprised they declined to look into it. christopher wray has great opportunity to clean house but so far nothing! 
hopefully he’ll reach his full potential elsewhere. i was rooting for him... smh … 
i have been nice to you all along..why did you did that to us..of all people..just to uplift yourself... ikaw p magsusumbong ng kung anu2 kla mo d ko malaman #sipsipkakasi #morningbadtrip 
so i bought a @ burtsbees new “honey flavored” chapstick and let me tell you, do not buy it. it smells like literal cat urine. just wanted to support a good company while simultaneously satisfying my love of chapstick.

did @ mccormickspices get rid of their rubs we can't find our cowboy rub anywhere? it was our secret ingredient. 
@ americanexpress losing out on a cc welcome bonus because of a technicality and being unable to do anything about it is just poor customer service. there are plenty of other options out there. 
u didn’t even come close for a selfie tho!!! 
c'mon @ chickfila. how you gonna confuse a grilled chicken sandwich for my 12 piece nuggets? this was supposed to be the highpoint of an otherwise crappy day. #hehadhighhopes 
@ blue_fant cane to see you pull them found out that you got out in the first round. 
that moment when your starving so instead of eating you watch food reviews, the fuck has my life come too 
gotta shill for the shield. 
there’s 2 half’s in a game, less than inspired football in the second half, especially defensively, poor execution from both sides of the ball, only our running game was impressive. blocked/missed pat, penalties..... 
i know a guy who would have had at least 5 sacks in this game. his name is @ 52mack_ #wtf … 
what the hell happened?! @ raiders

hey @ nbc, i don't care about the emmy's pre-show special and seeing a bunch of people in over priced clothes walk on some carpet...bring back my episode of @ jeopardy that i was looking forward to!

@ bonafideblack of all the people that could have made a bad predator movie i didn't think it would be you 
worst day of my life. starbucks ran out of my fav coffee cake.

visited the amityville horror house. @ vancityreynolds wasn't home. 
i think you've got a problem @ carrefourgroup #worm #disgusting 
it’s fine, sol don’t me the answer, wasn’t nearly as exciting as i thought it was gonna be!

@ adidas i love all my ultra or pure boost and nmds, but are these deerupts only made for 1 time use? 
well damn i feel a return comin on. i remember talkin to a guy in marketing about a year ago and expressed they really should expand the women’s hunting line. @ underarmour 
student council could have done a better job with the hoco week shit man !!!! 
#thepredator is the best film of the series so far.. said no one ever. what a pile of piss! starts off well, but goes downhill rapidly. well as soon as it introduces a bus load of lame ass characters who i couldn't give a shit about, & then there's the space mutts... 
so what its hard, its they job. they supposed to b trained professionals. if u cant handle it find a new job. everything doesnt require deadly force. they split decision cost lives 
sub plot of #thepredator big predators wants to live on our planet. we have 20 years until climate change kills us. normal size predator wants to help us prevent that it is everything a predator movie should not be awful acting, dreadful editing, terrible movie. 
and yet the ads they keep running say “loaded with extras”... #falseadvertising 
just realised @ netflixindia, @ amazonin, @ hotstartweets doesn't have @ friendstv. are you even a streaming service? for real

no victim of #sexualassault would agree to speak to the judicial committee w/o a fbi investigation. otherwise, it results in a ‘he said, she said’ fiasco. i actually believed that you would insure the precedented process would be followed.

#gallapark isn’t even open yet and i hate it. how do you promote @ djpaulyd for months and within 24 hours of his show you move him to @ energycincy..... the worst “night club” in cincinnati. 
@ drake super #disappointed!!!! how do you cancel and then reschedule for a #tuesday.... #lame #ruinedmynight 
@ megynkelly my opinion is you know this is your last year- you will get cancelled because of the double standard. you will try to make a move back to fox because there any personal opinion is taken for as standard. every victim has a right to not get bullied.

the girl in front of me has a karl lagerfield shirt and instead of his face i thought it was a dinosaur in the logo. 
googling my favorite acts and finding out that basically everyone on @ agt this year was already famous before the show...hardly discovering talent when they've already been discovered before. 
watching leap for the first time, and i'm slightly offended that they put all these little girls in pointe shoes, as well as the mc who has no real training or strength in her feet...such a small detail that could change a lot of young lives and teacher patience.

@ verizonsupport customer care has been a real dumpster fire. i’ve never felt like my time and experience meant less than i did after today. the amount of arrogance needed to have such little care and empathy is alarming.

c’mon man. two wears?!?! you gotta be kidding me. what y’all making these jordan 1’s with? i need answers! smh @ nikestore @ jumpman23 @ nikebasketball @ nike @ nikesupport #nike 
dear @ microsoft , @ apple , @ samsungmobile and the rest, i do not need a cloud. you cannot make me use a cloud. can you please stop forcing us to use stuff we do not need? yours truly, a person who grew up with your technology and has had enough of you all. 
what’s the point in paying $80/mo to ensure i get @ tsn_sports in 4k, when their 4k schedule isn’t even accurate? @ videotron 
@ kidells1 you look awful tonight. score should be 0 all. you let in 2 easy saves. #flyers 
@ southwestair worst flight in a long time. tv had terrible connection and kept disconnecting and something gave me an allergic reaction on the plane. finally home 
i saw that mel gibson was trending and thought "oh...is he dead?" 
thanks @ americanair for send us in ths plane, 
@ airheads okay what happened to orange and grape in the package??!! same price but get less airheads...very disappointed. put the orange back and bring the count back to 6. #grrr #iloveairheads 
this series of undatables is soooo boring 
@ themobmuseum -very disappointed that we were in there atleast a half hour on the 3rd floor when the fire alarm went off.wait was too long for my 75 year old mom. we left. what a bust for celebrating my double nickel birthday. u were closing at 6:30. #wasteofmoney

he played with a ton of poise and was smart with and without the puck. i am not an nhl coach or gm, but i thought he looked like a great 3rd line center from everything i’ve seen this preseason (and prospect tournament). 
officially left the republican party today because... they are neither conservative nor republican anymore. #independent #oldwhiteguys #notgrandanymore 
@ applesupport @ tim_cook #iphonexsmax #iphone no landscape aaaagggghhhhh wtf!!!!! this is really getting annoying!! its never 100% with this crew!! 
does mcauley think we’re not gonna notice that they gave a known homophobe the faculty catherine mcauley award? there are so many deserving faculty members at mcauley that don’t make their queer students feel unwelcome. your students deserve better than this. 
so, i can't support this team without supporting this coach? does anyone remember callahan? anyone? #huskers … 
got a bottle of the seasonal winter jack because i forgot it's essentially made for children... 
i can support this team and still not be a fan of this coach. they are not mutually exclusive. i've loved this team for nearly 50 years, but haven't always loved the coaches. gee, guess that makes me less of a fan. 
what sort of mcdonald's gives a 3 year old onions in a happy meal instead of their 4-piece nuggets? 
when all the big kids laugh at you because you made our country a joke. #un 
really disappointed in @ landtitle at the moment...deals crashing and we can’t even get a call back? 
it was live on youtube, he heli-bungeed into the grand canyon for his 50th birthday. after 75 minutes he didn't even splat or bounce back into the rotors. 
i was waaaay too excited to unveil my new pen cup today at work... no one noticed. i need a life. #offices #deskclutter 
yeah... it's no longer must watch tv for me. i wish she would focus on some of the amazing candidates out there that could use the exposure. white house sources are just bs. 
i wish i could have been able to go but either #tfc or someone else decided only mobile tickets were the route to go. they forgot about the people that do not own a mobile device. yes i know i am in the minority but we do exist. 
i’m irritated! if i invite u somewhere and i say 6 pm but u tell urself 7 and ur late and on your way, i almost cancelled and said don’t come.. #donthavetimeforthis 
@ wyndhamgrandhkt first time staying on your property for our 21st wedding anniversary. booked a ocean view pool suite and was put in the rear of the property with an obstructed view. first and last time.

@ glumobile been trying to reach support for over a week about a missing purchase. sorta lame no one can respond to email after email #lameaf #dobetter 
i still haven’t gotten any reply regarding about my missing package nor a tracking number. any help?... #boxycharmwheresmypackage 
@ primushelps just want to say this is entirely the worst experience i’ve had with an internet company. haven’t had proper connection since installation 1.5 months ago, still don’t have it, and apparently no one can make bill adjustments to reflect my lack of service 
a quick note to jose'.. #mufc 
i met you at the fan appreciation day.... after the redskins website media photographers were no long snapping, you walked by as if majority of the fans wont there. was my bday and was in front of you and asked for autograph, you waived everyone off and walked away. 
uh @ olivegarden why no garlic alfredo on the never ending pasta this time? it is my favorite! 
@ target ...who do i talk to for guest services? your app and call center are getting me nowhere. #frustrated 
man. i am in a mood. 
i use snapchat way too much to not have a yellow heart next to anyone,,,, #sad n #disappointed.

@ harristeeter stopped at the new waverly ht, had a beer and food from asian bar. great concept, but the food was cold. all of it.

lmao nature is a bunch of bullshit. they don't have ps4. they don't even have totinos pizza rolls. they just got that off brand shit. #nature #bullshit #bears 
hey @ benandjerrys what happen to all the brownie in the chocolate fudge brownie? 
not sure how @ chicagofire expect to build their fanbase when you can't even watch the games on t.v. #missingthegame #fire #soccer 
continually disappointed with the @ mlbtv app. i move to iowa and apparently can't watch baseball for any midwestern-based team. i can see blacking out one or two teams, but six?? ridiculous.. 
when the tomato @ zaxbys gives you is bigger than the chicken... 
@ starbucks i your emails telling me to try this new seasonal drink, but that’s tough when it hasn’t been available at our starbucks since it launched... what gives??

i find this vile language unacceptable from a qc. i'm so disappointed. #bethechangeyouwanttosee 
what a fucking baby. you’re gonna leave because trevor lawrence is better than you? you’ve got one year of eligibility and you’re gonna leave the greatest school on earth just to start at a place that won’t even compete for a natty. 
#kritiverma was the worst sanchalak in the task! plus are you guys kids? who says "dipika ko boo karo sab!"?? you have the guts to torture someone, have the guts to face it when the same comes back on you! jodis - singles - #proud #biggboss12 
wow. not sure why i'm shocked that the only tweets from @ bristolcouncil about @ savehamhouse relate to @ travelwesteng 
sorry mikko :( i came down with the flu and have been in bed all day. wish i could have been there to see you. 
i don’t know why none of the senators brought that up. 
@ samsung said i had to pay to send away and to be fixed!!! 
honestly what is going on in the us these days makes me feel increadibly sad, depressed and a little sick to my stomach. i dont understand how this is still going on. i can't visit the us again until this stops. #stopthemadness #kindnessmatters #youcandobetter 
what’s sad about all of this is that from now on this is how judges will be treated.... should have kept it private #sad #brettkavanaugh #supremecourthearing 
@ carlsjr i am customer of almost 25 years. you have given us froot loops donuts. the best fucking thing you could have made and today you have taken them away from me. i will no longer eat at your facility till you bring them back. that is all. 
in dr ford! the government seems to find pleasure in wasting taxpayer dollars in destroying this man and his wife, and daughters in front of the world for something that we are not even sure happened when these kids were in high school. 
@ panerabread *sighs* when they are all out of bread bowls and apparently people to clean their floors and their silverware.. 
@ officialplt why have customers pay for express and not deliver as expected? no actual tracking number is provided for a credible courier (fedex, ups or usps) something besides a track my order which tells you a date that is not accurate! #badservice 
@ lindseygrahamsc your a disgrace , john mccain would be so in your behavior today 
@ fathomevents trying to watch transformers first no pix, now no sound starting late 
john mccain would be rolling over in his grave if he saw how his supposed friend has become a trumpian and abandoned the core values of the republican party #personalgainovercountryneeds 
@ tesco so disappointed went to your midnight release for fifa to then get id’d and get turned away, i’m 16 for god sake 
his dear friend john mccain would be so … 
i am truly shocked by this one.. never have i had more in common with an artist before and these terrible bullies make it about themselves #voicepremiere

hey @ bookcameo- i requested cameos from three different people for my friend’s bday and all expired!! i understand these people are busy, but can they de-activate themselves if they can’t complete requests? #neednewbdaygiftnow 
why is it in this decade that all the food delivery apps won’t deliver an oreo shake from shake shack 
i got nothing done today besides semi-cleaning the kitchen. 
an environmentalist would had cried at the scene i saw @ scotiabankarena of an entire garbage bin full of water bottles bc you can't bring in sealed water. i dumped my water into the bin, kept the bottle, refilled it and will recycle it later. #recycle #watergate 
what's going on @ sling !? first you drop @ elreynetwork and now motorsport tv!? not cool, i'm on the verge of moving on from you guys 
wow i cant believe you would tweet this. omg 
does anyone else feel like no one knows how to behave like a rational adult anymore?? #disgusted #sad 
gave it a real effort today but @ att customer service proves itself to be lousy. time to make the switch … 
he was either very honest and convincing yesterday, or he knew exactly what was coming today!! 
just watched #queenoftheworld and megan said she had a very small blue piece of material sewn into her wedding dress that was from a dress she wore on her and harry’s first date. very romantic and sweet but why didn’t they show it?? 
sorry @ shondarhimes @ byshondaland but the new doctors aren’t hot. stop isn’t going to happen. owen is older and hotter even deluca is way hotter than this two. 
oh man not you too.. breaks my heart i have followed you for years!! you gave into the pressure. i cant imagine what it must be like in your industry. not able to think for yourself or give your real opinion! i thought celebrities were leaders not followers! 
@ xmenmovies you've lost a few movie goers. as a fan i can say i have been let down. pushing the release date again...greed from the studio to try and make more money during the summer. 
:my sleeping patterns are all over the place,too!hope you are ok!*hugs* (i just saw that #callumsmith was trending,& thought your hubby was on the telly or something,but it turned out to be some boxer guy. lol) xxx 
every time i begin to believe you will do yourself and the state of nebraska proud, you end up giving us nothing more than lip service and the realization that ultimately you’re just a poser. #disappointed. 
hey @ express whatever happen to those cool graphic t-shirt designs you used to sell?! every t-shirt now just has the word express on them... #alist 
just sat for 15 minutes at @ tgifridays at steele creek in charlotte, at our table, and never even approached for drinks. walked out. gonna find a different place. #badservice 
the moment you find out honda is only helpful if you get a honda. @ honda why sell cars you can't or won't service on your lot.. why not tell ppl upfront they can't get anything done at you dealership even if you sold them the car?

not impressed..doesn’t look like same team..we have to play better on the road.. 
wth!! "musk later admitted that the share price a nod to marijuana culture was a calculated stunt meant to amuse his girlfriend" … 
little annoyed with @ directvnow ... big football game on tonight and all we're getting is buffering. not an internet issue, other apps and devices work fine. my mom is having issues too. think it's time to switch. #buckeyes 
i thought you were a comedian..this didn’t make me laugh..

8 kdot songs surface online and none of them is the one from the beats commercial i'll still check em out 
purchased a $600 suit from @ nordstrom one month ago and already has a hole in it. manager said there isn’t anything he can do about it. i’ve shopped there for over 10 yrs and never have been brushed off so easily. think twice before buying an expensive suit there! 
nothing like doing a million service projects, winning tickets and still having to watch from the outside because the lines were insane. so disappointed in this years @ glblctzn festival. i’ve been the last 3 years and it’s never been like this. 
@ burgerking super disappointed in this, i thought it was going to be a spicy chicken sandwich.. nope. just some burnt things. #spicy 
penalties, bad defense and horrible special teams. so many issues. #huskers

went to @ lazydoghq for brunch and we sat there for over 20 minutes and no one ever even came to greet us. there was only 4 other tables seated besides my group. not a good first impression and we will never go there again. #roseville

wow, you have always been so good about being neutral and preferring to tweet about positive and innocuous subjects....you really surprise me here, unless i’m misunderstanding your point/intent. could you please explain? you owe us that. 
well dr ford doesn't exactly fit the profile of a serial killer so i'm gonna put my money on the bet that she's just an honest woman who wanted to let everyone know she was telling the truth. sad that you felt the need put this tweet out there kirstie. 
@ uber_support it is getting really f***ing frustrated the amount of issues i'm encountering with the services. on the same week that i am over charged for a ride. i'm charged for a food order that never arrived. #poorservices 
i give up on @ lootcrate @ askloot 
got burned by my #wellertools soldering iron, just thought it would have happened differently. i better hurry, it's going to take forever replacing motherboard capacitors at 77 degrees. 
we asked gus, our resident cat at tuggeranong station, to pull his weight by doing some work around the office. we promised there would be a mouse in it for him. we didn’t specify what kind though… 
@ chipotletweets put an thru the app and when i arrived to pick it up no one had an idea what i was talking about. it wasn’t ready. they had to looked for the order and had to wait for them to make it. where’s the convenience for using the app?! #sad 
my 21st is on a tuesday 
@ earl_thomas why would you flip off the seattle bench? is there some kind of issue going on behind the scenes? so inappropriate though. your grandma would be 
i believe that @ michaelavenatti is a fantastic lawyer, but i can’t understand why julie swetnick did that interview and then contradicted her own sworn affidavit. i think she should fall back unless she has corroboration she can supply to the public. 
i’m not in this 
i’m seeing a shocking lack of rain tweets from people on the phoenix area or elsewhere in az. here are low clouds in front of the santa catalinas. 
was waiting for glass to break somewhere … 
did not expect to spend hundreds of my hard-earned dollars on @ universalorl only to be constantly hassled by time-sharing hustling salesmen. it’s irritating and intrusive and ruins the immersive experience i thought we paid for. #canigetarefund? 
i'm going to jp slc show saturday and really want to check out your standup and special #idw guest friday but i can't get my bro to go with me 
@ cornerbakery - question? during last visit to the southlake, tx location this weekend found out they stopped serving the side #spearpickle with meals, why? no notice posted or sent out prior. 
you didn't add any vomit!! 
maybe i need to listen a couple of times through more, but after 2 times through the carter v is lowkey trash... 
i closed my facebook account, which means #worldballetday will be elusive for me (at least the live streaming). #ballet 
what a horrible thought.... #kavano … 
@ macys extremely disappointed to see a suit i ordered marked as cancelled, yet when i go on your site, it's now available but not on the sale price. guess you guys didn't want to honor your own sales and deals, huh? 
@ nflfantasy what do i do about kenyan drake? every week i read that he should go off but i end up #disappointed. 
michael, maybe you need to read this article for some perspective on #rachelmitchell's one-sided report: … 
@ robastorino this #westchester #ny resident is (as my father would gave said) that you're not taking a stand against @ realdonaldtrump @ cnn with @ erinburnett

when you don’t win tickets and don’t get your pin with your order from @ iamamerrickan @ linzylou12 sad day. 
women are facing more sexual and physical assault than ever before even at a systematic level and this is your takeaway? … 
that's pretty damn pathetic.

bought shalom a cool pair of light up shoes... “mom i don’t like these. these aren’t my style. they’re for children” was i the only one who wore light up shoes until 5th grade? 
i would rather have paid for tickets to the @ potus @ realdonaldtrump rally and known i was getting in rather than download a worthless ticket that doesn’t get me in. but i am glad that we didn’t drive all the way there and then find out we couldn’t get in. 
trump should have swallowed it!!! i heard obama secretly swallowed every ricin letter handed to him. trump should've showed his dominance!!!

why accept that it is "easy to see" why legislators would be so cruel to their own constituents? that attitude is one you should resist to the bitter end. people listed on the registry deserve every bit of respect, hope, and help that we give those 2/ #angry

in either case, the behavior of the judge was most concerning that he represents the best we can put forth to a lifetime appointment. to imagine this would be accepted is somewhat unbelievable and a discredit to the institution. 
@ wendys not quite the sandwich i imagined. that is a med drink, not xl. wow did these go downhill! not much bigger than 2 nuggets. is this the new junior? 
@ jeffflake so when there is a mountain of evidence about #kavanaugh & people are waiting to talk to the @ fbi about it, but they end the investigation after 4-5 days to submit an incomplete report. @ senatedems @ lisamurkowski @ senatorcollins @ sen_joemanchin @ nytimes 
yeah maybe if you see all the times i text you’d call me back by now .. 
from now on when i hear "senator collins" i will think of her by her new name: ofbrett. #scotus #collins

@ telstra once again disappointed with service. just spoke to a rep in credit management who would not let me finish a sentence. phone services restricted after a difference in understanding of a payment plan. this is why i won’t have my internet service with you 
@ lisamurkowski i am shocked that you would fall prey to the intimidation tactics of #diannefeinstein. if you cannot lead, you should step down. if you cannot tell those who give you ultimatums to take a hike, you shouldn’t be making important decisions for us. 
that rockies and brewers game was so...ugh. let’s see what the yankees and red sox got. #yankeesvsredsox #baseballtime @third world, san antonio, texas …

@ lisamurkowski , honey, i hope you know that you just wrote a one-way ticket right on home to alaska. #failuretocommunicate … 
you let us down in the biggest way possible - in your heart you know he is not qualified - his temperament and behavior during the hearing should have been your queue -clearly partisan/vengeful “what goes around comes around” 
@ senatorcollins are you feeling the #shame yet? that's okay, millions of others are feeling it for you. personally i am in you, i had you pegged as one of the good ones. 
you could’ve been a hero today.

went to @ disneylandparis for the first time brought myself a little snow globe to put on my desk at work - got home and it’s got something floating in it @ dlphelp #sad #disneyland 
it saddens me when i hear "the world is a shallow place, you have to change yourself because the world isnt going to change." with a mindset like that.. it's no wonder the world will never change... mindsets like that are what keeps the world the way it is... 
hard to believe that as a woman you would tweet this. 
so with the #vote. thank god for #music and @ davidbowiereal 
swear this niner team has played horrible and its pathetic things better change asap or its only gonna get worse smh!!! i smell a top 3 pick for sure!!!

@ tesla someone call me and tell me when my car is going to be delivered. if you don’t want my money i’m happy to buy something else. they told me at the mv store yesterday i would get a call by now. #frustrated 
i’ve never been one to complain about mccarthy, but today’s decisions made me question him. crosby obviously didn’t have it today (it happens) so why try a 56 yarder to go down 8? let aaron go for the end zone, or at least a first down... #packers 
are you serious @ sensusancollins??? there is no silver lining. the truth is that nothing happens to the men who rape, regardless if the victim comes forward immediately or not. n o t h i n g #believesurvivors #registertovote #byefelicia … 
what a horrible thing to say and think. #sad 
dear @ amazon the days where i could rely on you to get my packages delivered on time are over! the last few orders have always arrived late! #amzonprimefail 
@ raiders @ derekcarrqb how can you guys be this bad???!!!!! after all this time and being able to work as a team, how can you guys be this bad???!!!! #heartbroken omgosh 
best players all injured ! was so looking forward to this season but just been ruined #49ers 
when you’re so excited for your favorite thing ever, garlic twists from @ dominos and you get them and they look like this #hateburntstuff 
@ johnlynch49ers i guess we're back to playing like shit and losing every week! brick by brick, more like twig by twig because we break easily! #unacceptable 
used to like bob especially as he stood up for fathers rights against people who said fathers don’t have rights but mothers do but he’s pissed me well off now 
@ dunkinnytri @ dunkindonuts received this beauty after asking for a chocolate frosted with sprinkles. i'm cool if the sprinkles are not available but this is embarrassing. old donut. 
@ redroofinn super disappointed in your customer service. made a reservation online and not 5 minutes later the same exact room comes available for almost $15 cheaper. and no one can help rectify this issue. first and last time booking with @ redroofinn. 
new post: trippie redd says he’s disappointed in his fans supporting his ex girlfriend … #6ix9ine #fans 
i hate being 'managed' & the bbc is managing us. seems everyone must say the new #doctorwho is great. no. no it aint..! pc crap - its ruining something fab. 
so @ bbcamerica took a #doctorwho episode with a running time of right at 1 hour & stretched it to 90 minutes with commercials. it was literally 1/3 adverts & seriously impacted our enjoyment. 
@ mattyice_53 i hate to do this to you but first time ever going to @ chickfila in general and the drive thru here in fargo and forgot my fries and my dipping sauces. not what i expected!! 
i’m in indianapolis as well. direct tv now. i have all the other fox sports...but not this one. #disappointed. 
dear msnbc, shame on you for giving this hack kavanaugh so much air time. it's so unnecessary. 
@ 9news @ nexton9news if i wanted to watch trump i'd be watching fox. i want to watch local news at 5:00 not whatever drivel trump is spewing. 
fancy restaurants should have at least one other item on their menu for gluten free besides salad. #datenight 
@ waitrose went into your preston capitol centre store today to buy a quick snack and your "good to go" range isn't good to go. prawn or chicken salad with no fork how is it good to go. your floor manager said the cashier would ask if i needed a fork didn't happen. 
@ alexhobern you still didn't do the knock knock joke ! 
nothing surprises me anymore! @ thejohnabraham et tu? … 
this is the first one of her products i’ve ever used. 
@ morrisons very disappointed with #morrisons. got a parking charge notice for spending too much time at #morrisons. 
@ littlecaesars $7 for some wings and a 15minute wait. get your act together. #neveragain 
@ chipotletweets lies my fort worth chipotle wouldn’t do bogo wearing my acl wristband 
been buying the ea nhl franchise for the past 15 years, this year the game was great until the first update. now it’s 18 all over again. lesson learned for next year, don’t buy the game until you try the game after the first update #nhl19 #easports 
@ coldwatercreek you have not responded to my tweets about your abhorrent #customerservice & treatment of my elderly mother. is this the reputation #coldwatercreek wants? that they fraudulently charge the elderly and refuse to fix their mistakes? 
all i wanted was to see fiji #thecirclefinal 
i didn’t get in @ londonmarathon #virginlondonmarathon 
why were we not told about this before we voted to select the candidate? … i will have to think carefully whether i want to campaign for @ shaunbaileyuk in 2020 ( @ brandonlewis @ gavinbarwell ) 
was excited to go eat some @ kfc for the first time in forever so me and the family got the buffet. and it was terrible at our local store. not even one plate was eaten between 5 of us. 
why does no one know who the snow miser and heat miser are?????? 
missed it because of the hurricane! 
nope. they could’ve made it much much better 
also, @ panerabread, this is worth $9.29?? #ripoff #notworthit 
i’m amazed @ paulmccartney who “claims” @ johnlennon was like a brother to him hasn’t said anything about him - same goes for @ ringostarrmusic! @ georgeharrison has done, which is sweet but it only takes a minute from a busy schedule so no excuse. 
thanks. lol. 
then there's the death threats against dr. ford. 
hey @ theo2 what happened to having the same merch inside the arena. #bts 
@ ctv @ bellmediapr you couldn't have put more effort into keeping @ cw_theflash on one of your stations??? you kept @ cw_arrow @ thecw_legends and @ thecwsupergirl they belong all together you know! no live #theflash premiere in #canada sucks! 
i will never understand why people love their ex’s sloppy seconds i just don’t get it #gurlyallthatdesperate #nomaam #lonelygurls 
not former yet. why so quick to bash her! leave her alone. she’s been nothing but great for this country. i’m shocked u would even suggest this. i thought you were better than that. #disappointed. 
@ mjd shame on you man. i expect more intelligence from a former player in the nfl. wow factor doesn't win games. you know good and well it takes 11 men to execute their job on every down. showboating doesn't equal success. 
@ chipotletweets this is the burrito wrap i just recieved. #commonman #stilltastedgood 
@ brewers this is what you should have done all along when i was trying and trying for tickets and nothing ever worked. funny that i had nothing but issues yet you sold out the game. 2 days of this nonsense. i should be going. #thisismycrew #nlcs 
saw venom last night. but to find out woody harrelson is playing carnage in a potential next film is beyond disappointing...it's criminal. 
really?! 
@ deliveroo really disappointed with a delivery. arrives luke warm and looking like an absolute dogs dinner - toppings all slid off. that’s £13 well spent i don’t think. #customerservice #delivery #pizzaexpress @ 
omg @ etnow did not even show 30 seconds of the #withyou. video from @ mariahcarey #lamb 
@ americanair just paid over my day for more than a day because of refueling issues, made him miss his flight, and didn't even pay for his hotel. customer service is going g down hill and i'm sorry to see such a venerable cooperation treat their clients so badly 
this is the second time @ fiveguys has put tomatoes on my burger instead of pickles.... how do you mess those two things up? 
hmmm, never heard you promote it on @ btlsradio 
jess! really?!? it’s called the slow play...you don’t open with “i hold the record”. you open with “bet you some fancy birthday bourbon i can beat you,i’m just ok”...then take him for everything he owns. 
once again, the #liarinchief puts himself above those less fortunate. i don't know why i even bother to hope that just once he'll do the right thing. 
#jackandthebox . it's not a bacon & blue sirloin burger w/o the bacon!!! valley hi location in sa needs to remember the bacon. 
@ cheesecake who’s idea was it to get rid of the cherry glaze cheesecake?! sincerely, a depressed cherry cheesecake lover! #bringbackcherryglaze 
. @ danbarreirokfan @ jgkfan i stuck with the program on the edge of my seat waiting for acorn fruit loop to call. need less to say, i’m disappointed #acornboy #unicycleboy #movebacktoportland 
i understand that you have to get a large in order to get the stickers.. my point is that it’s disappointing.. i will go for breakfast instead of lunch or dinner, as not only it’s cheaper but you get stickers on the entire trio without paying more or wasting food 
i used to love my nest thermostat. my wifi went out 2 weeks ago-everything was back working except for my nest (app). i've been "offline" for two weeks-cannot remotely check on anything. tried plugging it in (usb) & everything else. nothing works. 
i don’t think i’ve ever seen a hurricane that didn’t get downgraded when it hit land. #hurricanemichael2018 @ weatherchannel #hurricane #hurricanechris 
nobody interested? 
made @ walmart grocery order today via their app, it charged me a $9.98 delivery fee. groceries were then delivered by @ doordash. driver said they don't get paid an hourly wage & only work off tips. i was not expecting to pay $9.98 delivery charge plus a tip. #fail 
@ hotstarpremium i'm getting this when i'm trying to watch @ bigbangtheory on #hotstar app on my amazon fire tv stick! been watching it daily with no problem. and now this!!! can you explain? btw, my premium subscription is valid till 28 nov 2018 
i just love how @ xbox can give free hardware to pc players. gg. it's highly laughable. forget all about the small time people that are die hard console players like myself. 
@ homedepotcanada this is what your mississauga south store 7112 gave me today. 8 rolls or $50 worth of dead sod. 
@ jimmybutler jimmy, grow up a little. you should be a proud marquette graduate with a phenomenal opportunity to play in the nba. your behavior today is embarrassing. 
@ whataburger 3rd straight time we had to wait 30 minutes in a thursday night for a cheese burger. will not being going back next week for our thursday night tradition. #disappointed. 
45 minute ticket time for a luke warm tour of italy at the canton #olivegarden tonight. #disappointed. not blaming server and will still leave a good tip but wow this isn’t the olive garden i grew up with 
still waiting to be paid by @ wilhelmina and @ alyceparis for the runway show i worked in september 2017!!! #payup #payyourartists … 
as much as @ foxnews can generally be relied upon, two of its major players are suspect. from the #kavanaughhearings right through to the current #missingsaudijournalist incident, both chris wallace & @ bretbaier have been weak. #deepstate sleeper operatives, perhaps? 
not gonna support crocodile tears of commoners/jodis. the damage has been done already. i hope #shreeshant understands this. he can be naive but not stupid. #bigboss12 #bb12 
carly was so happy to see sam go right for jason and hold his hand. i really wanted her to bring it up today in her scenes with jason. 
and no camouflage in sight! 
psa: don’t ever order a black bean burger from @ chilis... mine was horrible and burnt to a crisp and i was never even offered a new one... had no taste to it what so ever 
#bbcqt i'm sure you could have found a more energizing & inspiring panel if you had tried a little harder - surely? what you have subjected all of us to today, is simply not on... #bbcqt 
i suppose it's fitting that the @ nhl & the @ nhlpa would come to this decision on #dayofthegirl either take the stance of #nomore, or just publicly declare you don't actually give a damn about the survivors of domestic violence. … 
i literelly can't stop hating you @ transenterix too many grey areas in your financial reports. for me that's clear don’t you have no real sales. @ nyse @ ft 
my boyfriend surprised me with 2 dozen beautiful roses-too bad they died after 2 days. he was supposed to receive a call back from @ ftdflowers to resolve the matter but no call. #wontuseftdagain, #flowerfail, #ftdfail, 
#disappointed. i thought @ georgewbush__ was cool. 
if it wasnt for kennys this was also a loss ... 
he sooooo f****** stupid!!! kanye west doesn’t care about black people. 
hey @ sheetz my large chai doesn't seem to measure up to your kiosk diagram.

@ burgerking ordered 60 nuggets only got 50, so at #burgerking. i'll never forget to check when i order from #bk again. 
@ larosafreehold 6 of the tiniest tenders ever recieved from you guys. 
@ anania00 fake fan 
funny, coz one member of ur help team told me i was on the list for this restore only to be told by another that i'm not and my rewards were never returned #poorcustomerservice 
smoking? really? 
people are frustrated, confused and downright irritated with the flows and prototypes. when will your team prioritize this and put it up? we are tired of asking. zeplin and invision have had this out of the box for ages now. #frustrated #goingtomove (2/2) 
so saw the rickmobile but it kinda sucked.. lol 
how does @ rylan not know the routine to #bbf @ _clairerichards sort him out 
nothing like getting home and finding your burger undercooked, way undercooked. i can’t eat this @ burgerfi 
when you feel like under stress and pain. always go back to the basic. love your self, smile, and always be thankful to god for the blessings received each day. #earlylaps 
@ htempestphoto just got school photo order forms. why are you using a colour background? the colour contrast looks awful. 
@ dominos shockingly rude when dealing with your ealing branch, usually amazing... #dominos #rude 
i’m with you herschel. tara what has happened to you? you have become what you claim to be against all because of trump. you’ve joined the leftist bullies. 
@ tacobell is it normal to get hardly any topping on your fries?? from your location on ottawa street kitchener #tacobell 
@ whiznewscom second straight week y’all haven’t aired @ ohcashexplosion... are you guys no longer a broadcast affiliate of the show? #epicfail 
dear @ bwwings in salina, please set better expectations on wait times for your call-in/to-go orders. i waited 55 minutes after the scheduled pick up time before i got my order. no manager engagement to check on me or the people waiting in line. 
frost flat out lost that game. who doesn’t kick a field goal on 4 th down in overtime? #dobetter 
i was depending on you to reply to my text but you didn’t #itiswhatitis #khairadega 
but they’re still giving sm a platform and including meghan in it for them to get ratings. 
i was out so i wasn’t watching the game but wtf? #psuvsmsu 
@ maybelline care to explain? 
i like psalms 150 in terms of enthusiasm and instruments used. other than that it’s all personal opinions being shoehorned into theology to make a point. #theologynotopinions 
going to church without friends again... so sad 
it’s literally spooktober, yet it hasn’t been that spooky. smh 
@ flotus it was hugely inappropriate for the position you hold. have some damn class. you act like a third rate hooker not a first lady. #bebest 
extremely disappointed i’m @ ecupiratesfb and @ ecuathletics. not one person, player, cheerleader etc except for houston has pink on for #breastcancerawarness #embarrsed and #houvsecu 
. @ allbeautynews really disappointing that despite paying for next day delivery b4 2pm where my order was confirmed and money was deducted, i have yet to receive the item. i wanted it for a birthday first, i went empty handed. poor service. #badcustomerservice 
if you didn’t want to play, you should have let the #braves win! #dodgers #soldyourfarmtogiveup 
smh can’t believe how people can become so disgusting!!!! i’ll pray they don’t hurt anybody with their demons #sendinglove #nohate 
dear @ delta probably not a great thing when the shake shack @ jfkairport terminal 4 is a better experience than your overcrowded lounge......why did we pay for business class if we can’t even sit down while we wait for our flight?? #delta 
#forzahorizon4 #forza why is the online such a mess?kicked after every race to single player, friends free roam won't connect, stuck in menus when they set up a showcase events, not being able to connect to forza life at all, events disconnecting half way through! 
@ directv having issues. jen got me apt for a tuesday but to replace my 5yr+ receivers i’d have to sign on for 24 more months. unreal. long time customer & can’t get new equipment. time to start research sling & hulu. $200+ a month & don’t take care of your customer. 
from the way the storyline is going, i hope this is empire’s last season! 
@ friendlys hey levittown, ny: where’s the rest of my chocolate fribble???? 
@ dallascowboys i flew my disabled father to a game for his 60th birthday with a party of 6 and have never been more disappointed with disability services. we missed kickoff and the national anthem because of employees giving us wrong info. 
@ 931jackfm seriously you’re here at tom reid’s for a promo and no rod stewart or cindi lauper music? #promofail 
@ amazon i wanted sunday delivery, not sunday night after dinner in my damn pajamas delivery. i was expecting to use what i ordered today, not next week. 
c'mon guys what the hell is going on 1 win 5 losses @ azcardinals need to step up guys!!.. #sad #letsgocardinals 
can you also take a picture of something that's bigger than normal size for me? recently there and nothing was bigger as i expected.

tim is in maggie 
so @ kfc just told me they don't make hot wings anymore... fuck wrong with you @ kfc... best shit ever... 
as a lifelong michigan native, i'm over @ bwlcomm's failure to take more expedient action to help local communities adopt better alternatives to internet access. wish companies truly valued innovation and quality of … 
you went from one of my faves to someone i am unfollowing. your voice note was evil and disgusting, regardless of what manny did. you are clearly no different. i hope all beauty gurus aren’t like this behind closed doors, but i’m losing hope. 
@ amazon i consider myself a huge fan but after the two months of calling tech support with a promise of a call back to resolve getting into my own account, i am done! i have been told each time someone from leadership would call and not once has that happened 
why didn’t @ bbc show the whole game, @ raiders @ seahawks #licencefee #nfluk 
@ nfluk i was robbed! 1 hour for the game?? @ seahawks365 @ raiders just settled in- and pow, it’s gone! @ bbcsport #nfllondon why?? 
even after all the hate i trusted @ jeffreestar but guess this proves that something i said must be true to make him take this step. guess he really is what they all say he is. 
right when i started relating to him i see this... … 
@ hottopic this would be the picture i show if my order for a single great ape vegeta didn’t get cancelled. #thanksforlettingpeoplebuyuptofive

saw nihsquirrel and nihcanadiangoose but no @ nih_bear today. 
@ bombino_express in the first call you ask to pay $80 extra to get it delivered on time and on the second call you say that the shipment is missing #hatebombino #fraudforextramomey #cheat 
are you disappointed with the results of your marketing strategies? #marketing 
generally love @ charlestyrwhitt shirts & been a loyal customer for yrs. sadly i wore a shirt once- spilled coffee & it won’t come clean! bigger shame that customer service said nothing they can do. 
@ snapchat is so so so annoying now ! you got all this pages about people you don’t give a fuck and they appear anyway! the fact that it’s now taking forever to load is driving me nuts ! i’m quitting ! #boycottsnapchat #snapgram

no relation to guy de maupassant :) #bookworm 
so so disappointed in my first @ fabfitfun box. hodgepodge of obviously leftover items. makes it even worse that their cust care is a bot and not a real person. debating cancelling. #terriblecustservice #botreplies 
aw man, i did the 24th 
it really sucks when you think your biting into a chocolate chip cookie, but it turns out to be a raisin cookie. 
i normally love @ startalkradio but that panel was a disaster. really detracted from what @ samharrisorg was saying. felt like skipping a stone across the top of a pond. 
so @ itvpresscentre @ loosewomen you’ve axed familiar faces for old ones, #theyleftbecausetheythoughttheywerebetter i’m off 
@ chacousa after my chacos got lost in the “mystery pile” i decided to just order a new pair since the original pair was not eligible for a “lifetime warranty claim”, yet my order was canceled without notification because you couldn’t validate my address.... 
juan you’re just feeding into the lefts nasty and always negative narrative about the president. you are the one liberal i listen too, but unfortunately lately you’ve been following the other sheep. 
i wanted her to be green 
when @ 2k & @ wwe completely drop the ball by hiring an phony to voice @ johncena in #wwe2k19 and not the man himself. #pathetic 
for the first time in a while the opening of the @ nba season has no interest to me. the lack of competition in this league is a problem. it’s a long season for a 2 team race... #nba @ nba @ espn @ warriors @ celtics

#vadachennai any kdm issues no response from theatre so for.... show gets delayed @ lycaproductions @ wunderbarfilms @ dhanushkraja 
when you pre ordered @ roseellendix & @ roxetera ‘s book in july and have been waiting since oct 4th to get it in the mail just to find out canada isn’t getting it till may... sorry i’m canceling my order... #wassoexcited

i would really appreciate it if #usa n #china, stop using nationals from other countries play proxy to their industrial war... smh... like can you both just leave us out of your shyt... 
@ worldmarket - your delivery service is awful! 4th time waiting on them, two no shows and a reschedule i wasn’t notified of. they requested i be home early today- but they are an hour late. no return calls from the store! #selectexpresssucks #badservice 
absolutely #poor service from #johnlewis well over a month since handing in my laptop with added care for repair and now i get a call saying they cannot do it and i should call the third party company. #customerservice 
@ c4thecircle hmm that #uncovered episode was crap! i was expecting unseen footage and stuff!! just sat here watching a quicker version of what i watched for the past 3/4weeks! 
#lazybooking @ wwegp 
@ northernassist disappointingly difficult to reclaim for a cancelled train. it's your obligation. #refund 
i was expecting actual care bears in the video... 
watching ‘all eyez on me’ reminds me of a lifetime movie 
not surprised! 
been waiting for over a month for my break pads from @ rockauto_parts and they have yet to either refund me or send my product again. customer service has not helped. probably won’t purchase again through them if they don’t fix this asap. #poorcustomerservice 
@ chipotletweets , we need to talk about why your queso is gritty. 
it’s supposed to be 3 nights and 4 days of passes but it became 1 night and 2 days! wth!

you should have been at shadow council tonight - there was some nastiness showing from some of the cllrs and poor chairing.... allowing members of one group to be rude and off topic but silencing those from other political groups! 
dear @ ericchurch, i. love. your. music. and you put on a fantastic show, however, i cannot justify spending $282 on two tickets that are in the nosebleeds in an arena with crappy acoustics. i’ll stay home and listen to all your albums on april 26/27th instead. 
@ chappyssocial tried for first time. mediocre service and order was wrong. 
i was talking to my roommates about the original goats and they didn't know... 
we ran out of elastics at 288! #badluck #unfinished 
if this is the racing scene at swindon, then its sad. the track has long ago seemingly stopped caring about live audience. honestly the bookies streaming is ok for me. at least make it mandatory to put a saturday night on and have minimum live punter entertainment. 
okay shane bby, ily but wtf the one thing i really wanted to hear about was his family and where he came from and how his parents especially greg paul fucked this kid up and that’s where it seemed like the series was leading and there was nothing of the sort ): … 
never thought i’d say this but the place i work at now is one if the worst. from the supervisor to the hr generalist! 
thought we made it up! 
well these taste like soap 
@ ericchurch great music disappointing church choir membership ... refund request never answered. no concert tix pre-sale code !!! 
that moment when i remembered what my mama told me once... “don’t always expect everyone to be as giving as you. or you will live a life full of disappointment.” never could imagine having to learn this lesson. #shouldhaveknownbetter #lifelesson #momalwaysknows 
this is the last time i buy shoes from @ paylessinsider walked at the park for 30 minutes and the shoes are already wearing significantly. #garbage 
nfl has not been welcome in my house since this was allowed to continue, banned by all accounts.

have you lost your damn mind???? i guess we have a different definition of what’s moral, right, and just.... 
@ nikkihaley disappointed by your speech most recently. you were actually, a rep who, as a dem, thought i was relatively less divisive & more of a true american. thanks for sealing the deal ~ you’re all full of sh*t. 
#annoyed and with dr. phil. he took the time to organize a distinguished panel of guests to discuss and speak about white privilege and then devotes a lousy hour to such an important subject. not for nothing, this segment should have run the week! #droppedtheball 
know what sucks @ saundersfarm? paying forty dollars a head to enter the park and then having an attraction ruined by staff asking people not to take photos. maybe put that stuff on one of the rule boards around the park so your staff don't break my immersion? #wtf 
it's weird how it's been several xpac we have no vendors anymore, but i'm still thinking at the end of every bg "ok let's check how many honor points i've got and if i can at least get a piece of... oh, wait..."

watching #charmed reboot. i keep looking for original charmed things. this is first time a show i loved completely has been rebooted. i’m not enjoying it... should have made it more like original charmed. 
really @ kleenex ? you had the opportunity to put “sneeze this moment” and you didn’t. i’m so 
@ wendys this is not a baconator?

@ jetairways experience#10.website shows message not allowing me to access my own booking. "please comtact our customer care". i call up customer care to seek help & even the agent is unable to solve the problem. then the call is cut on my face by the agent. #poor

i never expect this from you 
that we never learn & we are our own worst enemy. @ e_reid35 & @ malcolmjenkins - if you feel that way or if it's true leave it out of the media. go talk man 2 man but 2 b a leader u have 2 have leadership skills. #sad 
i live with a houseful of people who prefer the junk parmesan cheese that should be criminal. no matter what amazing fresh grated, shaved or shredded parmesan variety is in the fridge they always grab the crap #probablyswitchedatbirth #whoareyoupeople 
@ chipotletweets you all need some quality control on the app orders. it read correctly on the order and receipt but was completely messed up in both my mine and my wife’s bowls. 
have i missed a story on @ foxnews about @ gosnellmovie and the media blackout? i watch @ thefive @ seanhannity and @ tuckercarlson every night and haven't seen a mention at all.

just came from seeing the #halloweenmovie in my opinion it wasn’t as good, as the others. i won’t give any spoilers. really there is none to tell. 
trubisky, despite his stats, had a crap game. how many overthrows and terrible red zone decisions are we gonna get from him? not as bad as cutler was but still not good enough. -mm

just want to give a special shout out (wtf) to @ hulu for putting one punch man in my lineup and making me think for a split second that there were new episodes. i was crazy excited and now i'm back to being dead inside. #anime #sadtweet #notangry 
@ amaricooper9 thank you for 3 1/2 wonderful seasons. i loved seeing you in the silver & black and i wish they didn’t have to trade you away. good luck in dallas and make them regret this move like they regret mack! #amaricooper

well, pixar has officially rejected my pitch for “the last bloodbath”, about and old pitbull in georgia named gus who realizes the last dog fight is often the most important. #writerlife #familymovie #pixar

@ rylan sorry but the way you ask q's about lewis is aimed at promoting anti lewis responses. when you get a positive one you immediately come back with another. not something i've seen you do before 
@ trello asking politely for you respond to your paying customer @ citizensireport (katie g) regarding the deletion of her trello boards in which i used often! please give her access to her research, she’s not asking for the board back!! #bettercustomerservice 
it's terrible were teaching kids that it's okay to play dirty. it's okay to want to play dirty. it's okay to try to injure people and break rules in the name if winning. i find it despicable. 
@ uber refusing to refund a charge on a corp card. deflective and non responsive messages

i hate when people in power misuse their power. a police officer flashed his light & sirens at me just because he was too impatient to sit at a stop sign. he literally turned it all off as soon as he got in front of me and was just casually cruisin’.

i never ever thought the grinch would be a socialist.

rewarding customer loyalty with a ‘tile mate’ @ o2 i thought you were better than that. having been a customer since 2001 i find it hard to believe that a tile mate is a suitable alternative to the bottle of moët that was offered. would love to hear your thoughts

received my @ madebygoogle #pixel3xl yesterday and have to say i'm not enjoying the sound/speaker quality. the reviews i've watched say it's an improvement over the 2xl. not in my experience. everything is muffled and muted. thinking of just keeping my 2xl. #sad

no one knows what to believe anymore... i don’t believe either side at this point. 
rightfully so. where was the #msm outrage at the ricin letters delivered? or steve scalise being shot?? rand paul being assaulted? shall i go on? i decided to follow you because you seemed different...you really are not.

wow @ americanair — recorded boarding announcements by a computerized voice are so impersonal! what is happening to my airline? #iflew100kayearforthis 
@ fanatics is the worst. their shipping options are confusing. never expedite. you won't get it when you think. and they won't refund. won't be a customer going forward, which is a shame because i buy from them regularly. #beware #consumerprotection #chatbotisslowtoo 
still no response from you, @ wendys. i’ve been unable to mobile order for over a month now, but it’s not an issue on my credit card side. can you please look into this 
@ airtel_presence i have had enough of you guys. it's been 9 days that i have registered a complaint. 10 extensive calls with your executives and a descriptive mail later, i still haven't received a resolution. don't promise a solution if you cannot put your word. 
gotta be honest, @ burgerking , i was looking forward to the philly cheese king... was disappointed when i got mine... only one slice of cheese, hardly any cheese sauce, and not a single teeny-tiny bit of caramelized onions. 
@ outback no more chicken quesadillas?! this is the one menu item that would make me stop in to satisfy my craving and it's gone. i think we're going to have to break up. and it's not me, it's you! #goodbye #quesadillalove

been standing waiting on my pizza for almost an hour now when everyone else after me has got their pizza. how is mine not ready yet when i ordered mine an hour and a half ago? @ papajohns 
i am so upset with @ colehaan. i did an order 2 days free delivery. called and confirmed arrival, and after 5 days it is still now here. i am traveling tomorrow and the delivery arrives on monday . that’s what i call #badservice #badpromise #upset 
i am livid and i can’t stay quiet about it. i can’t believe how @ twitch is handling this badge process. people who paid to access the venue for three days of the convention are being forced to wait in 3-4 hour lines just to get their badge for convention access. 
just ordered the halloween pizza from papajohns. why does it look like a pumpkin left rotting outside three days after the holiday? @ papajohns #letdown 
does @ wendys not serve “hot fries” anymore? i got fries today and they were cold and hard. i really wasn’t a fan of @ wendys fries in the past, but when they started serving “hot fries”, i became excited. the fries today ruined my whole meal. 
@ sarahfreemark @ ctvottawa sadly i'm turning you off. advertising fur, really? 
at the airport and i hear the following “may i have your attention please..” was hoping the next line was “will the real slim shady please stand up?” no such luck though #smdstreams 
damn. misread this tweet. 
hey @ kfc, thanks for my big ‘ole box of deliciousness. looks a little sparse, don’t you think? btw, i didn’t need the sauces i asked for, so it’s okay you never gave them to me.

i thought he was going to fart and knock it over. 
i thought girls were supposed to dig generic messages from strangers. i'm going to give this a shot one of these days, see what happens. … 
@ packers should permanently bench ty montgomery to teach him a lesson about not giving @ aaronrodgers12 a chance. #unbelievable 
that @ packers loss is just about as bad as the sean slocum-led 2014 special teams loss against the @ seahawks. looks like another wasted year in the finite career of @ aaronrodgers12. @ weshod @ tomsilverstein @ tomoateswsj @ marktauscher65 
no one likes a finger pointer but ... 88, ya really screwed us today. @ packers #gopackgo

@ reynoldswrap #nonstick #mybutt i’ve used this foil, both sides and neither work on #chickenwings so 
ty montgomery with such a dumb decision just robbed all of us of what was sure to be another great aaron rodgers game winning drive 
i haven’t seen the corpse bride on any spooky marathons whatsoever this year 
i’ve never been so disappointed in a human being in my life. you’re right... you’re not who i thought you were. #dontworryimdone 
wasting 3-4 hours watching this crappy ppv #wweevolution i lost all interest in this show when ronda vs nikki was announced and now especially lexi is out of action 
is it just me, or does #evolution feel like a glorified house show? #wweevolution 
have to be honest, if the same support team runs this division as the one running pc peripherals, good luck getting a response. i've had this broken naga chroma for how long now and i've never gotten any help. 
@ minskyspizza we love your pizza but what's up with the skimpy salad?? yes that saucer is what the salad was on... the bigger plate was only to lay the breadstick on. 
@ freyaridings travelled all the way from newcastle with my daughter to leeds gig .. staying overnight .. cost a lot! .. concert #priceless waiting for a pic with a total of 3 other fans only, wanting a quick photo and autograph only to be told no to the photo 
i’m not a big fan of the new #netflix #sabrina show. sadly, the best scenes were with the school friends instead of the magic stuff. (coming from a viewer who wanted the magic element to be the main draw.) 
disgraceful we don’t get to see/hear what lewis said that was so bad. take our money, want our support but don’t air a vital event. #fuming #feelletdown #cbb 
so are we not seeing anything at all surrounding the incident? as a viewer i feel robbed #bbuk 
wtf was that about?! we have been waiting for 49 hours to find out what lewisf did/said, and they haven't explained *anything*! on friday, emma willis said we would be shown what happened. #bbuk #bigbrother 
@ lagalaxy you guys better clean house and spend for quality players next season. that was some bad soccer this season. 
@ oneplus @ getpeid @ petelau2007 @ mkbhd #oneplus6t great phone but not available in @ amazonaustralia @ australia

@ jessiej i seriously bought tickets to see your show, and also traveled out of town just to be told 45mins before the show that it's canceled. 
@ nickiminaj @ iamcardib & y’all wonder why it’s male dominated... 
i looked on my phone when i saw the post hours again and couldn’t find them, thought maybe it was just because i needed to be on desktop version but guess they sold out quick. 
saw a cat laying on a drive way. tried calling for it and it wouldn’t move. probably because it was a t-shirt. 
#c25k #forrealthistime ouch. pace slowed a lot. plenty of flat footed arch pain. i feel beat up, but the big run day is this saturday. #mynextrunwillbebetter i need more hydration and more light.

@ emmawillis @ rylan am an avid fan but not happy that lewis was made to leave, with the reasons not being shown. yet roxanne was allowed to stay in the house and her storyline was allowed to run and run. @ bbuk

@ spencers needed customer service and visited the google site for my local spencer’s. went to your call service and selected option 1 for local service. surprise! told me to go to the website. did that. live chat wasn’t even live and i wasn’t using a mobile device. 
@ uniqlousa i placed an order 10 days ago to be store delivered- haven’t heard anything, haven’t had an email back to my request (it’s been 24+ hours), and spent more than 30 mins on hold trying to speak to someone before giving up. you have my $$$, where’s my stuff? 
30 minutes into baggers night and not a single trick-or-treater. 
my mom texted me saying that my dad bought pretzels to give out for halloween...can't believeeeee we're that house 
@ playstation why wouldn't you include classics for the #playstationclassic ?? you're missing crash bandicoot, jet moto, and grand turismo #fail 
how is eli apple worth a 4th and a 7th but haha is only worth a 4th.. the @ packers better do something with these upcoming picks.. 
i know rahul is lovely but i feel like was to fill a narrative for the producers about rahul’s “journey.” ruby and kim-joy both better bakers, especially ruby, who hands down won tonight’s final. #gbbofinal 
so they finally got to you and wore you down? tsk. i thought you were stronger than that, ye. 
really disappointed today, after listening out for the ribblemere interview i did with the lovely emily @ thisisheart, all i heard was half a sentence in the news saying that the ward opened today. #perinatalmh #letdown 
@ epa you should look into the services of @ wasteindustries. their employees only recycle what they want, leave garbage scattered on the street and they don’t follow up with loyal customers of 10 years who pay extra to recycle and try to do right by the environment. 
@ scentsy purchased a warmer which doesn't melt anymore. been trying to get some response and customer service sucks! #badcustomerservice #upset 
dear @ espionagebeauty i know you sent the email stating things were backed up but it would have really been nice to have halloween nail wraps for halloween. #nobooforme 
pointless preload was pointless 
rahul has been the most irritating contestant. kim joy 100% should have won that surely? she’s by far the best baker. i refuse to watch next year. #deflated #gbbo18 #gbbo 
are you going to extend the time for pc players today? no way most will make the time slot after re-downloading. 
ahhh!!! they’re finally remaking/rebooting robin hoo—- oh, yeah. a live action one with no foxes or snakes 
well, i’m hoping that @ canadiantire still has @ kerrscandy kisses, not a single one this year in my daughter’s halloween bag. #happyhalloween 
four. that’s the number of trick or treaters we had. and they came together in the first 15 minutes of beggars night. 
hey @ mmschocolate thanks for the empty bags of m&ms on halloween. got at least 5 empty bags tonight #trickortreat @ 
still looking for a good bubble tea place 
a little surprised you don't make your kids say thank you in mandarin chinese, ancient greek or latin. 
this is very poor from u guys, leave the trash talk to the players not u as an org 
2+ hrs on phone w/ senior @ apple tech support 2 days ago didn’t resolve. had me take it to authorized repair store. they have no definitive answers. why would apple release such a poor os? been a user on & off since ‘88.

i haven’t seen an outraged vegan yet about this. 
i just checked.... my "like" button didn't do anything new. 
wait - what? no. it is not true. and to say so perpetuates harmful assumptions about victims, experiences & service needs. it might be true for some victims, in some parts of the country - but we expect more (& better) from you @ polaris_project 
@ westjet you really gonna have a sale and then shut your site down so i cant log in to book a trip??? better be back up before the time cut off... #westjet 
i have yet to see anyone give out tricks. 
i'm a little ticked off by the performance of my #ringdoorbell. it never connects live anymore, and i've been getting a lot of black screens... i pay for a monthly service and it sucks... may be time to move on 
is this even a real person responding... after 4 hours of stress and confusion at the msy airport, trying to work aa, the least aa could do is take care for us customers #missinghome #somuchforcustomercare @ americanair 
well it was all staged so i’m sure y’all aren’t to surprised. your rabbi didn’t help y’all like you hoped either and that’s why he left! he stated live that “it probably won’t help your “script”” and nothing will really happen. that’s why he left! #lostadayonefan 
seriously @ americanair!? on a 787 “dreamliner” and can’t event put the tray table down flat since it’s resting on my legs. 6’2” doesn’t seem that tall until you fly coach. should i pay double just to not be crushed? 
oh please do!! not one person that said they were leaving if trump got elected has left this country... 
also @ marcus_theatres pickerington if you knew there was an issue with the temperature in the theater when i bought my tickets why wasn’t i informed so i could then not waste my money on a movie i won’t be able to even enjoy now? #marcusrewards 
$1 view with a $600 price tag. 
there are so many people who didn't have tick or treated this year. i almost want to get a po box so they can send them to me. #halloween #candy 
why report this? i know reporters, and i know you can't honestly believe that his self-aggrandizing statements are truth? clearly, @ oprah does not 'like him very much'. yet you present these kinds of statement(s) as fact. should have a "oh, no, no no' from @ oprah. 
@ nbcnightlynews it’s too bad journalism has taken such a negative turn. journalists used to report the news, not push agendas. #changethechannel #notwhatitusedtobe 
you know, i would've made far more headway with advancing the gay agenda if someone had told me about the homosexual-inducing drugs. … 
awful service by @ fabledbeauty & @ ocado ordered something i need for a weekend away tomorrow and driver arrives to tell me item is ‘missing’. told to call customer service who were as useful as chocolate teapot #notgoodenough #lostcustom 
@ kitkat @ kitkat_us where's my wafer? why is there no wafer in my kitkat bar? #why 
allergens need to be taken more seriously! please retweet! #hersheys #allergy 
who killed jfk? now that’s a mystery. who killed khashoggi? not so much. in jan, larry fink @ blackrock made top 50 world leaders by calling for ceos to deliver profits plus « positive contributions to society ». sooo... apparently a lot can change in ten months. 
bit disappointed with my @ papajohnsuk order tonight. was really looking forward to bacon and cheese wedges but they weren’t cooked fully and some were black inside! 
so here we are 2200 and nothing. so what happens now? i’m going away tomorrow for 24 hours. so unless it arrives before 1000 i won’t be home. i paid for next day postage because i knew i was going away. it’s supposed to be a present i’m taking with me. 
when you wait an hour for delivery then receive this smh @ papajohns 
i spend around 200-1000 hours on each #supersmashbros game. i'm really sad to find out that they took away trophies from #supersmashbrosultimate. it was what kept me playing those games. i played through every mode with all characters to unlock everything. 
not sure why but this has happened several times ⁦ @ delta⁩. already boarded flight and waiting to take off and still no upgrade. 
jeeze now my work crush is letting my friend @ justinjobes prank me! #notsurprised 
can’t believe @ starbucks did me like that. got a notification that if you purchased holiday drink on nov. 2nd you would get a reusable red cup,”. ordered one and they told me they “ran out.” why are y’all still advertising if you’re not gonna have any. #starbucks 
@ seanhannity i don't want to hear anybody at @ foxnews say how they support @ realdonaldtrump because you guys have not shown any of his rallies ... 
anyone else get sooo excited seeing the aldi advert thinking it was the coca cola truck then totally crushed it was just kevin the carrot why ?!?!!! #savekevin 
@ wwe you really need to step up these ppv's because each show is getting more horrible! #wwecrownjewel #wwe #whatsnew 
as a public school educator for 20+ years, must say, i never knew my fellow teachers’ political views until two years ago. don’t understand where this whole ‘resist’ and anger crap came from but not diggin’ it. #maga 
i want to coin the phrase "scientific sociopath": a scientist who knows the work is deeply flawed but doesn't care as long as it gets published/funded. one who lacks a sense of personal integrity in scientific work. anyone else know one? #academia #phdchat #phdlife 
@ iccdpartners resorting to social media since i can’t get anywhere calling your office. my son was tested 12wks ago and still no report. #parentsbeware 
on a day when it had been raining nonstop @ usps still delivered this package without anything to protect it. the contents were soaked and nearly ruined. @ ups and @ fedex always cover with at least a bag so the package doesn’t get wet. 
i’m disappointed that the barista @ starbucks today decided to change how the red cup promo worked. does it not say until supplies last or does it say it ends when the barista says it ends? 
then the barista calls out nutmeg latte...um i ordered an eggnog one. so basically i ran around all morning and got cheated out of spending even more money than normal so i received no discount, no gift and a regular latte with just nutmeg? #paying4freebies 
neco and nabteb should not follow the same path of their ancestor, waec. 
i love the christmas season more than most people, but i really dislike the jump from halloween to christmas i'm feeling right now. @west tampa, florida … 
@ texasroadhouse still have to wait 30 min after a call ahead reservation. no prime rib left after we were told there was some. unable to sit the family together. had to squeeze 6 people to a booth. #uncomfortable #texasroadhouse 
so let me get this str8, @ blizzard_ent you put forth a lot of effort and resources to make things like a hamster in ow or paying any of the @ warcraftdevs for what they have done to wow but you literally shit on @ diablo arguably the game that made you. #blizzcon2018 
@ nbcthegoodplace i’m a little bit you didn’t bother hiring hungarian actors for the speaking role... or even get someone hungarian to do the translating i’m sorry but accents and phrasing were way off... otherwise great episode 
same here! i was checking on my newborn & got escorted out. waited all yr for this show. now everyone is posting pics & videos!! smfh 
@ blizzard_ent @ diablo why waste money on a mobile game when you could be spending it wisely for example like bringing better content to the pc/console versions or remastering diablo2 and making the game great again. you know you can do better! 
@ oreo’s normally fill me with lots of joy. these however, did not. 
i haven’t had a @ cadbury’s twirl for a while but “treated” myself to one today. only to discover that they have shrunk considerably. seems like they’ve taken a normal sized one and halved it. shame really. used to love a twirl. 
coach i'm disappointed in you. stick to football. an endorsement of any trump supporter is an endorsement of racism. this hurt. 
i looked every time. 
you are welcome. i tried to include you in a pm with @ agentasiansmith & @ chickeffect. i wanted to be there for it but i'm old and i'm a diabetic so i fell asleep. didn't plan to. #disappointed. 
@ royalcaribbean @ royalcaribpr after some direct messaging - unfortunately we’re still not happy with their ‘blanket customer service approach’ formal complaint now going in 
there wasnot any and will not be.....thanks to headless chicken government 
i came across this message and haven't received any update. 
@ tacobell it seems your staff at one location is using the codes on the double chalupa boxes. i just tried to enter 2 different ones and it says invalid or used #tacobell #xboxonex 
love @ panerabread but when i asked if i could get different bread they said all of the bread looks like this... so it’s all burnt??? they said yeah sorry.. 
agreed! i folded the one side in half and it still didn’t make half a taco. 
by @ usafa football tonight. i think a team captain flipped off @ usma at the end of the game. we are #better than that. we lead people and control our emotions. we are #better because our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen deserve #better. 
there was a lot of red in the stands #bbn 
@ fabfitfun i've been a member since the start in canada and i am very disappointed that i couldn't customize since the site was down..... only to finally get in and see there are sold out items already. 
@ morrisons your pulled chicken burritos had absolutely no chicken in it #wontbuyagain 
@ applesupport drops a new operating system now i have to buy my kid a new phone but it won’t be a new iphone been @ apple users for 10yrs 
@ lenrhodesprez hey maybe the hervy firing was a mistake after all .. what a waste of a grey cup year 
just tried again at the 13th and k-96 location in wichita and was told "we dont do a combo of fries and rings. if we did, word would get out and too many people would want it." 
well, that's the first time i paid extra for dark meat. @ swisschaletca #takeout 
@ roryos17 why did i not see you break any tables today?! 
@ netflix - it’s a hazy, empty ending that begs the question: why make this at all? i am disappointed. @ kevinspacey - you were the soul of the show. #houseofcards #finale 
exact thing happened to my mom at the t-mobile store! @ johnlegere @ tmobile @ tmobilehelp 
so far through 2 episodes and really not impressed. at this point, i’m going to have to force myself through the rest of the season … 
on a serious note, did @ slipknot release a demo? cause 1, you can’t heard corey, 2, there’s no slipknot sound at all. those that have been a fan since day one know what sound that is. #notyourkind #slipknot #iowa 
twins @ speakerryan and @ nancypelosi are so disgusting. i don’t know which one is against @ potus more. it’s really a toss up. can’t wait for ryan to exit stage left, never to be seen or heard from again. 
tonight's episode of doctor who was awful. what the hell did i just watch? i have doubts now. #doctorwho #chrischibnall #series11 
was told that my approx wait time was 15 minutes. i gave up after 30 minutes. @ giantfood @ peapoddelivers guess i need to find a new delivery company and new grocery store. 
my mini @ oreo bag only had four of these. 
@ netflix what was that.!!!???? #houseofcards ending was so open ended.. come on guys.!! atleast you could have ended the show with a good ending.. it was like #netflix didnt even watch the show themselves before launching the season 6. 
daylight savings time has always sucked. add a kid. now "fall back" is more like getting drop kicked into a different dimension. a dimension that still lacks transporters and holodecks. 
ground staff for etihad air at bangalore airport has no consideration for customers. outrageous behavior by the staff. needs some serious attention to save it's reputation. @ etihadairways @ etihadhelp @ etihadairwaysar #etihad #traveldiaries 
i’m sorry but the first episode i was not impressed!!! #houseofcards 
cannot believe how dead the last ever bb final isbig brother is ending and their last ever finalists are the most boring out of all the characters that went in there this series #bbuk 
haven't seen this one all day! 
it's funny how i could think no other show could have a worse ending than dexter. house of cards proved me wrong. what a waste of a series finale. so many unanswered questions. so many unnecessary and forced scenes. such a shame. #houseofcards #season6 
if you commit to something, make sure you can follow through on it. i see where your priorities lie...thank u, next 
wouldn't get too excited mate... 
@ skyhelpteam very #disappointed!!! as a new customer i had high expectations from my new broadband provider but i’ve had no internet at home for a while now and being told “there is nothing you can do” is not good enough!! 
you are such a disappointment. if there was anyone to pick up the mantle and reunite the republican party. i’d thought it was you. how wrong. 
just watched #houseofcardsseason6 
@ bpnutrition i sent a msg with a defective product a week ago trying to be considered and not blast on sm and not even an acknowledgement of receipt came my way 
treat people with kindness isn’t just words. 
i have a confession to make guys... i'm really ill, right and i felt a bit hungry so i was like big up the 11pm bowl of cheerios and fully almost put the milk in first. honestly unfollow me now. im so upset with myself :/ 
@ marksandspencer i couldn’t find your canned cocktails in your st anne’s store, are they not stocked there? could they be? 
#zoe facetiming her son? thought there was meant to be no contact with the outside world ?? to hear this #breakingtherules 
just starting to watch #bbuk and #bbcian, i’m gutted. #disappointed. 
@ mcdonalds is it too much to ask for hot fries? i’m a mom, by the time i get them they are cold anyway, but they taste better if they were hot first. 
would love to enter the @ barbour christmas competition but there is a fault on the website which doesn’t let you enter 
@ sonicdrivein why is it the past two times i went to your drive thru i’ve had bad experiences. 
@ jeffglor is dickerson going to cry again if republicans win again? i thought cbs removed those who switched from reporting to supporting in 2016. 
when you ask for a spicy chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes & bacon and they give you this cold ass shit !!! smh @ wendys 
sooo you spit in the face of your and my ancestors who were beaten & killed for this right, because politics ain’t perfect? you don’t use your voice where it matters, but announce in on twitter like you did something magical? i thought you were smarter than that. … 
@ nike come on, i bought these kicks a couple weeks ago & have used a handful of times during workouts. they are already coming apart?!?! what gives? @ nikestore @ nikesportswear @ nike #poorquality #nike 
@ uefa man, you guys suck at selling the canadian tv rights to some online company, @ dazn_ca and taking it of regular tv 
i’ve had @ aflac for years... i went to the er bc i’m sick— now you all don’t cover personal sickness unless i’m hospitalized!!! i have 5 policies and none of them get used!!! i need answers asap 
asos are going to do nothing about the fact that they messed up my delivery, it was “lost”, then “out of stock”, “though i’m a premium member, things don’t always go to plan” according to asos... it’s a shame premium doesn’t actually mean anything … 
cna it’s a disgrace that you keep promoting donald trump as pro-life. pro-life means supporting life at every stage not only when it’s convenient for you or when it’ll get you votes! this man is the furthest from pro-life that it gets! #fake #liar 
@ tweethue any chance the outdoor spotlights are going to be in before the holidays? seems like they have been out of stock for a very long time. #frustrated #badproductrollout 
@ attcares i got mistreated today by 2 at&t employees: one lou who didn’t care to look at my face while i was talking to him at the att miracle mile store, and mandy on the phone. shameful, shameful service! #attfail #attsucks 
@ evernotehelps i finally got a response back from evernote support after 6 days. i spent a huge amount of time fixing my problem on my own. when your evernote is down, you need help asap...not 6 days later! 
i’m done. #yankees cashman.. why is cc returning when there is kluber, paxton, corbin, happ, morton, keuchel and eovaldi out there? and it’s for 8mill? so gardner got 7.5 and cc got 8. that’s 15.5 million on old players that needed to go!!! #yankees 
so that was just a claim... again. … 
i expected a bit more from an account with 11k tweets. 
@ miwayhelps so glad that your rt 3 bus runs every 10 mins, but have been waiting for almost 20 mins at islington station for a bus. #socoldwaiting #schedulefail 
wow jonah, i didn’t know you were so cruel. 
@ kendrascott i went with a girlfriend to buy matching mood rings tonight and left totally disappointed because the 8 was too tight and you don’t make a 9. so sad!! #bffletdown #manhands #lovemykendra 
i was hoping you were going to get more childish. is this really the best you can do? … 
. @ potbelly well, i had to give up on your free cookie offer. the app wouldn't let me add it unless i paid for it... just one more of many issues using your app, maybe someday you'll fix it. #potbelly 
when i was 16 a girl came up to me and told me i had legs just like barbie. i was so excited until she followed it up with "yeah they bend backwards in the knees like hers do" #bendylikebarbie #hyperextendedknees #talented 
women being scolded by other women who don’t share the same views. thought this group was designed to support, inspire, and empower women. @ alyssa_milano any thoughts? … 
@ areuthe1 picked some trashy women to be on the show this season 
i don't understand either, and i'm a native... 
just watched the ending to #ark and... . there are still a ton of unanswered questions even after the video and survivor notes. not much of a surprise at this point. guess the best thing to get from ark was all of the stories/experiences of trying to survive. 
since when does @ att not help transfer information over? just bought a new phone and was literally handed the box and told we could “figure it out”. not what i would call the best customer service out there. 
senator i was duped into thinking you were truly a man of the people. your words now ring hollow. 
i guess i was deep down hoping for an actual #bluewave that would sneak up the potomac, through the streets of dc, and ever so carefully wash most of the gop out to sea. 
i don’t want to admit it but i am forced to accept the fact that no one cares for anyone but themselves #lifeisntfair 
i’ve had two packets of roast chicken crisps tonight from #aldi and both packets have had smokey bacon inside #whycantihavesomechicken

hey @ daytonmbb not happy that the arena “improvements” resulted in an obstructed view for the seats we’ve had for years. 
my licensee really isn’t gonna re-new itself, is it? 
@ dunkindonuts why is that every time i go to one of ur establishments they always out of coffee/cinnamon rolls? always empty-handed. jus leavin dd on 677central ave albany ny (manager vick) and again none! smh 
shame in you @ aldiusa for advertising a wine advent calendar that everyone wants and only stocking 15 per store. selling out in 15 minutes is ridiculous. not a way to treat loyal customers. #notachancetogetone 
am i surprised at the results of the #californiaelection ? no. am i ? once again, yes. 
i was very ready to buy some paper, y’all. 
mobile ordering is suposed to be convenient, but @ mcdonalds has made it utterly inconvenient. every time we've used it, our order has been wrong& we need to go inside or back. #neveragain 
@ fitbitsupport yet again my fitbit blaze has stopped working following a replacement in august this year! blank black screen despite doing a reset! bad experience! if you are thinking of this product look elsewhere! #fitbitblaze #fitbitsupport 
nothing he does surprises me any more. what surprises me is how many people are willing to support his actions. 
hey @ mas ! why no alcohol on an international flight from sydney to kl? also, no dinner. just a piece of 15 x 5 cms of bread with cheese and mushroom, called as chicken pizza! #quality 
bernie, feeling “uncomfortable” about voting for someone based on their race is racism. very disappointing coming from you.

@ amazonhelp when is my prime membership going to be free? when 90% of the packages i’ve ordered in the past 2 months, hasn’t arrived within its shipping range and has been late. failing to provide the service that i’m paying for. #annoyed #amazonfail 
fast forwarding through the ads and thought gregg wallace was doing the paper review but no it's bloody toby young #skypapers 
one of the biggest problems that cause customer dissatisfaction is to tell them you would do something to rectify the problem they report and you don't 
applied for a research grant to understand why all primary school children aren't accessing water safety lessons in sa. got knocked back. children need to learn swimming and water safety. 
dissatisfied with rayners lane branch of #pizzahut they deliver wrong pizza what we are not eating , even isha manger was very via web form,they promised me to respond within 72 hours,,4 days over but no reply #badcustomerservice @ pizzahutdeliver 
. @ h1z1 #h1z1 the season level tells you the grind av been reset 150 kills ahead 
@ starbucks quality control has seriously been lacking the past couple months. 
when you give all that you can in order to show your support, it gets taken for granted & you're then let down. people always show their true colours in the end 
@ paparazziaccess just had a disappointing conversation after over an hour of wait time between 2 separate phone calls today trying to resolve an issue that is still unresolved. #newconsultant 
@ lovellrugby really disappointed to pay extra for next day delivery and get a text saying it will be delivered today. yet no parcel .... needed it for a holiday tomorrow.... 
so disappointed @ asos_heretohelp - ordered a blazer premier delivery to come today, get told it will be delayed until tomorrow. now being told it won’t be here until monday and my birthday outfit is ruined! 2nd time recently i’ve been let down by late deliveries!

i looked at my espn app and saw "unc/duke" and got excited thinking tht we were getting an early christmas present having a unc/duke game for the second game of the season.... until i saw it's football.... 
most of the tickets are already for sale on the ticket resale websites. total bollocks for us fans that have been waiting to see massive attack for a long time. 
@ buster_espn oh buster, you’re usually so good at not running with ‘un-things.’ it’s kind of a shame. 
@ thelastleg fab show guys but why no mention of armistice? 
i thought trumpie jr was getting arrested today??? 
it's too late to suspend her now! why wasn't she suspended the last time she was found guilty of tampering?!! or the time before that?!! the republicans knew in advance that snipes and broward county always cheat, yet did nothing to prevent it in advance! 
@ uspshelp what good are delivery instructions of the driver never follows them!? been waiting all day at home for this package that was needed by tonight. discretion or not he/she could’ve knocked on my door. #angry 
@ weatherspoonsu so much for your “loaded” chilli chips!! bare bones and dry as hell

ordered a blazer on @ asos week ago and now it's on sale. the difference in price is noticeable. customer care answered me: the only option is to send the product back and purchase it once again. so not practical and not efficient!

@ farrowandball any reason why two tins of paint bought at the same time from @ bandq would give such radically different finishes?! we are three dry coats in on freshly plastered walls that were perfectly white and have used the same roller throughout.. #stiffkeyblue 
i liked a @ youtube video i cancelled my playstation classic pre-order 
they must have like 10 of everything @ clickfrenzy 
… imagine what this sort of money could do for #grassrootsfootball. absolutely #bbcfootball

@ stewuk booked in haste forgetting they were out of the country that date, so selling the tickets on for more than double the original price? wtaf? #makesmybloodboil #spicegirls @ bbcnewsbeat can't you help us stop this happening? it's not even funny 
me ha gustado un vídeo de @ youtube - i cancelled my playstation classic pre-order #disappointed). 
@ townetoyotaofnj @ toyota hey, big shout out to the service dept for not doing me a solid to quickly fix a tire that had been leaking since a rotation 2 days prior at your location. only had to stop twice to put air in it on my way home to try to fix it myself. 
hey @ applesupport i can’t seem to find the new possum emoji. i see a raccoon and a mouse and a porcupine and whatever the heck this is but no possum!!! there’s even a freakin brontosaurus! 
you have placed your dislike of potus ahead of everything else. in you. 
not good :( by the time it was my spot in line tickets were over $300 each. maybe next time. have a great show! but maybe the #universe will help me out on this one! 
not good. sold out after i waited and waited watching this purple person slooooooowly move #whatarethechances 
@ netflix you guys really screwed up big this time ! your #shera reboot is the worst thing you have ever had on your streaming service hands down. you hit such a homerun with #voltron, how could you fail in such an epic way with this reboot??? 
harrison springs tourism advises whoville you have reported is not true. you may want to consider editing your article. #factcheck 
@ tmobile @ johnlegere none of these deals reward the current customers. i thought we were going to have a magenta friday but it doesent seem that way anymore #tmobile #ijustwantedsnewphone 
@ michaelavenatti jacka$$ just because you and i loathe trump, doesn't mean that we are friends. 
will be but wish we could have sent them into the stadium via bear walk. 
that's all, folks. … 
@ zazzle i placed an order for my sisters wedding. the delivery was #delayed and when finally delivered all we received was an invoice i need this resolved asap. #unsatisfiedcustomer #needassistance 
why didn’t @ alyssa_milano get the job? 
yet thousands of criminals are crossing our borders. do what you campaigned on. lock people up instead of “reforming” the criminals that are already there. … 
preordered two copies in june. they shipped this morning....so i guess i'll see y'all in two days #reclamationday 
guess i’ll never know bc the code i got w/my box was already used. i have proof from my text, receipt & picture. neither company replied to my first tweet i’m not expecting much this time. all i wanted was a fair shot, but i never got a chance. #customerservicefail 
just finished a trial period with @ xfinity l have had 3 service calls to my house to fix “technical” issues. customer service has been no help. @ verizonfios looks like i’m coming back! #customerservice #askme 
tuned in to #bbcqt as i heard barry cryer was on. turns out it’s some dullard called barry gardiner 
@ wrongsideofpond, the fam and i spent some time in your old stomping grounds today. expected to see your kit retired and hanging in a ring of honor. 
seriously?! don’t make the team you want so you quit?! 
… the complete and utter sexism and anti-womens rights bullshit i'm reading in comments about this sickens me to the core. #ohio 
thing i learned from jury duty: you don’t need to understand over half the verbiage used by the courts to be an effective juror. #help #america 
@ rcchristmas i have tickets for tomorrow— any chance the show will be canceled? or any way i can be refunded due to this weather? @ ticketmaster #christmasspectacular 
a children’s toy/clothing catalogue just showed up for my boss. this message on the cover is so not what we should be teaching our children. 
@ hsbc_uk just a quick advice. train your staff. especially the telephone one. they are clueless. if it takes 2 months to process the opening of an account i can’t imagine the relationship and service i will have with you after. 
@ inspired_ts thoroughly disappointed in your organisation. raising over £1000 and still no resources after 4 months! do you know how hard schools work? #schoolpe #primaryschool 
@ flo_tweet great gig but no you’ve not got the love. #florenceandthemachine 
haha that wasn't very scary now was it … 
what. no. just no. where’s the christmassy feel. i love all of your christmas adverts except this one.... bring back the penguins or the hare and bear... #gutted #letdown #whobuysachildapiano 
i don’t know about you but i am still stunned at the mid term result. #goingtohellinahandbasket republican house leadership has been mia 
@ freschetta not one piece of chicken & a feeble amount of veggies 
too bad you're only talking the talk, because clearly walking the walk is too difficult … 
@ albertsons i bought over $100 in groceries. i get home and your product was expired. i tried to return them at a different location and was told #no, because they would lose a sale and would have to lose money! how about #lostaclient! #ridiculous #disappointed. 
becoming more and more disappointed, today isn't looking like i was hoping for at all. a few indictments can turn my frown upside down. 
this #cuse basketball team looks like they have no heart. they played with zero urgency this week. not a single player looks improved. i know they miss frank but they looked defeated in both games before halftime. #disappointed. 
#fantasticbeasts what a sack of shit. can i get my money back please? 
can’t believe i’ve been backing up @ wellsfargo saying, “they might have messed up in the past, but they have always been good to me, i love banking with them!” only to be sold out to @ flagstar #notcool so what banks do people recommend? 
jeg kunne lide en video på @ youtube i cancelled my playstation classic pre-order 
still having trouble understanding why people have a problem with counting an election's votes carefully. lost a lot of respect for a good friend who called a candidate a "sore loser" for not conceding the recent election. the integrity of elections matter. 
@ troycornes gave me a mbb poster and didn’t sign it 
@ southwestair just got to a list on my leg yesterday but can’t waitlist today to get back to my family early as my leg will not post until i finish the round trip. #fixit 
• a #pessimist can’t be because he or she expects the #naught. 
@ mumfordandsons did you guys sound check in dublin coz half the arena can’t hear you??? also you blocked out half the arena with your ground ‘stage’...possibly one of worst gigs i’ve ever been too and there’s been a lot! #soundcheck #giglife 
this is true, @ southwestair , but a musician without his merch will not make enough money on the tour... #lostluggage 
not gareth then 
@ insp_tv i'm sad that you guys aren't marathoning little house this weekend, in honor of katherine macgregor # 
those other 9 locations are important. no box can capture the moments that a real live person sees! #isphotopassworthit ?? 
@ applesupport it genuinely disgusts me that i’ve been a costumer and pro-apple product influencer since 2012 and have been told that i have to pay out of pocket for a new phone because your recent update disabled my logicboard. 
@ applesupport please explain to me way i have to pay out of pocket for a new phone because your update disabled my logicboard. i’m a college student, i can’t afford to pay for my own mistakes let alone someone else’s. 
i was a litle bit disappointed by fantastic beasts: the crimes of grindewald. the movie has a lot of fanservice. #fbawtft #sad 
feeling really ripped off. paid £18 each to see #coldplay #headfullofdreams at the cinema. three days later it’s available at no extra cost to amazon prime subscribers. seems so easy for somebody somewhere to take money from the die hard fans 
i almost got my tattoo done with lynyrd skynyrd playing in the background #cheated 
family shouldn’t lie and steal from each other. 
what’s the point..only a few sang a big band song!! 
i’m just going to say it... wtf was ahs apocalypse 
#hertz tulsa airport have me a maker's car last night. returned it today and they rewarded me with a lesser vehicle whose tank wasn't full. no attempt to comp a president's circle member with something better without an additional charge. 
can someone plz explain how @ ashalexiss always has way better service than i do with @ sprint when we both have the same brand new iphone? your employees blame it on “tower latching” and to “update service” often. doesn’t work. 
today i had a @ homedepot employee tell me the solution to fixing the corner of my ripped up carpet was to “cook [my] bunny for dinner, goes great with a glass of wine!” he failed to note that i am an angry vet student who had a few words to relay to his manager. 
@ mcdonalds gonna make a complaint. when you bring something back particularly the mcrib then make sure you have it at all locations. it hardly comes back and when it does i can't enjoy it so thanks #nothappy #boycottmcdonalds 
said it all along inexperienced dancers are my #favorites as #bruce would say. deduct points for experienced dancers like #ashley may stop watching 
noope. nothing. i can't watch series. i can't work on anything. what's the point of getting a "v fiber" connection if it's not even gonna work 
@ big_bella i would have expected an established italian restaurant chain to have lasgne when ordered on a saturday evening. 
@ westjet you guys really suck. my flights have been canceled and changed 3 times in the past 3 days. stuck in london gatwick for 3 days now i can’t get out of toronto. i have a family and a job to get back to..i’ve missed workshops i was scheduled for #poorservice 
i chose my @ southwestair flights, entered my info & payment for 2 tix, clicked purchase, & got error message. told to call agent. agent says “i can help you” & btw those flights are now $140 more. i don’t think that’s right. why didn’t you honor that price? #travel 
still no preload available for the next patch. 
btw, i just upload the same video on #facebook the quality is way superior bad, bad #twitter #twolittlestars 
color me #disappointed. i won’t get paid for aircell, eloqua, and ariba with bribe taking scott as my senator. this suxs!! … 
@ redrobinburgers if you're going to offer me bottomless broccoli, learn how to cook it i feel like i just ate stale undercooked rabbit food 
i had to stop watching my beloved @ raiders this year after another “rebuilding season”. #jongruden has ruined the raiders again. like so many coaches before him #artshell #norvtruner and so on, they come in and destroy the team only to be fired in a few years. 
really @ amtrak @ amtrakvacations ? no wifi on autotrain to florida? kinda one of the major perks of train travel. #customerexperience #fail 
i remember when @ ctv used to show us all the floats and bands from the #santaclausparadeto but this year they let a lot of them just go by without showing them. 
i understand the msg of this yrs ad as does everyone else i reckon. but it’s still a poor offering compared to previous ads. it’s more about elton than anything else. uninspiring, no xmas feeling. it’s definitely no monty the penguin, bear & hare or buster the boxer 
this might block up their email box i’m just hoping it gets there as i had wrong email now to send the evidence via post #complaint #jobdone 
@ starbucks i got a hot apple cider tonight, but there was no apple in it?? prob the worst drink i’ve had from here. #starbucks 
why doesn’t skip the dishes deliver movie theatre popcorn? #skipthedishes 
@ revelschocolate out of 101g of revels my bag had 100g of chocolate covered raisins! #bringontheorangecreams 
waiting for noel edmonds to be a contestant on #imaceleb kyle got the wrong person. he meant nick knowles! 
@ eagles our secondary is literal need to make some changes asap! #phivsno 
awful. every time this comes on tv i cringe. not christmassey at all. you appear to have lost your way. 
lol why’s the mcdonald’s christmas advert better then the john lewis one? #christmasadvert #johnlewis #mcdonalds 
@ carters this is what your reinforced knee pants look like after approximately 6 wears. doesn’t seem very reinforced to me. 
whoever cast jack black in the holiday should’ve been fired for merely suggesting the idea. i’m #hurt and
