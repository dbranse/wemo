further proof that the label is applied to all who criticize

you always pick fights, public fights with persons of color. hmmmmm why is that? anyone who claims over and over again to be the “least racist” person you’ll ever meet only means that there’s someone who’s “more racist” than you, but racism is racism no matter the degree.

i am old enough to remember the presidency of richard milhouse nixon. i despised him. currently, i’m having a lovefest with old “tricky dick” compared to what we’re dealing with now. watergate was nothing....the co-conspirators now were elected not appointed. think about it. 
when the history of the united states is told the republicans in the house and the entire @ gop will be the reason this 200+ years experiment will have failed if they keep doing what they are doing. party over the democracy & constitution.

there's a lot going on under my lumpy suits and my "hair" that i'd rather not discuss, so let's focus on what's important -- the poor victimized men (most of whom have worked with or are me) who have been falsely accused of abuse! 
sack pence! he is obviously leaving out details when you're sitting on his knee as he reads out the news - sorry, fake news - to you every morning. p:"now, donald, what's this word?" t:"train? titties? trump? pelican?" p:"no, donald... it's treason. can you say that?" 
. @ realdonaldtrump was a b-list celebrity who wanted respect & acceptance from hollywood, the elite, & the press. he became president of the united states only to be hated by hollywood, the elite, the press & the world. #sad. #shitholepresident 
unfortunately not in today's world of social media 
des moines' southridge mall is so sparce these days, they don't even bother to plow the whole parking lot. 
@ google the stickers for @ android messaging sucks. @ whatsapp and @ gosmspro have much better designs. why can't you do better, even with all your money? 
the gop has become the #donthecon party!

chad is upset. why'd you not wash your hands? judging you. you eat with those. 
hey @ espnulacrosse and @ getspectrum why is the @ hopkinsmenslax game blacked out. i have sounds but no video. 
john kelly is just another #twistedtrumpet. … 
ha! your hypocrisy is so transparent, but you think you have everyone fooled. intelligence level = snail with a stroke. i hope that when you're re-homed, your forever owner makes sure you have all your shots and gets you neutered, as all responsible pet owners should. 
bill has transitioned to a “get off my lawn” guy 
#desperate 
i mean, this is a joke, right? the repubs and faux news was relentless in obstructing president obama trying to find anything to drag him down, so sad, all they could come up with was a tan suit scandal and the big mustard brouhaha. 
if you need to report me for that sounds like your melting , just saying - but your fearless leader says worse- 
@ nbcolympics @ nbcsports what happened to the scheduled 1:30pm est broadcast of luge? website said runs 3 & 4 today @ 1:30pm but no-go.

@ potus you have been the best thing for stopping legal immigration no one wants to come here anymore from another country as long as your president immigration is down legal immigration is down people not wanting come here anymore 
there are literally countless incredible restaurants in new york i've never gotten a chance to visit yet i've eaten at the remarkably underwhelming "metro burger bar" at laguardia at least 6 times. 
i remember when i cared for you. you wasted my time and effort. now you steady wondering why i have no love for you no more. 
i normally watch disney movies when im and i haven’t yet so you already know 
he said it... i’m just repeating. ‘with @ realdonaldtrump in power, he feels included’. as do less popular racists also... … 
@ realdonaldtrump’s top level staffer, did this. once the staffer was exposed and forced to resign, @ potus reasserted the staffer’s denials, wished him well, and gave him a glowing recommendation. no mention of his battered victims… #sad! … 
is it discrimination to tell the #truth? why’s it so easy 4 people to believe & accept that blacks are better athletes than whites/asians? when was the last time you saw a vietnamese on a pro bb team? you can’t alter the truth bc it makes you @ … 
this is so true. and so #sad. … 
concerning the gop poll on trump job’s performance, if you don’t want to be bothered by the gop in the future, please, be careful with your personal data. and don’t forget there is no bad publicity for trump... 
your right .. it’s this whole drew storyline that needs to end yet #gh keeps writing for them. of course drew is clueless that’s he’s part of the reason why nathan was shot. sam knows but can’t speak her thoughts. #jasam 
he will probably be next in line for chief of staff!! apparently he meets the qualifications

drat i accidentally deleted an awesome tweet of mine from last year 
you cannot ethically serve a "deeply unethical" person. they're incapable recognizing nor appreciating your service, it has no value to them. #resist … 
this reminds me of the many stories about donald trump showing up at charity events, taking the stage to create the illusion of giving, and then leaving without ever having given a penny, let alone having purchased a ticket to said charity event. … 
dear @ realdonaldtrump your are on track to bust the deficit at record levels. unlike your businesses that you bankrupt the government can’t shirk their financial responsibility. 
no need to, because of your whining.....a lot of liberals have shared your profile, and now we all follow you, so #sad!!! rotflmfao!!! btw, it really is quite funny when you whine and complain, please continue to act "like a little bitch". 
little human 
… 
i’m so sad that people think this way & equate murderous horrific regimes to the us. she is a perfect example of the absolute failure of our education system where people are indoctrinated to hate america, one of the most free, decent countries in the history of the world. 
last week they all but implied porter's ex-wife's face attacked his knuckles new strategy is window dressing at best #cnn 
some lady ordered a @ starbucks breakfast sandwich, took the bacon out and left it behind!! #sheleftoutthebestpart 
how are your hotels doing these days? “room rates at trump’s hotels have fallen by up to 63 per cent since he became president”. in a nutshell - not good. you should encourage some of your deplorables to rent rooms. 
i seem to remember when mexico had 2 earthquakes last sept. millions in property damage, over 700 dead and many more injured. not even a fucking tweet from the potus. 
i learned today that laziness is no excuse for putting hot fudge sauce below the ice cream. #truthmelts 
i just dropped a whole pan of freshly baked red velvet cupcakes on the floor

mum is convinced i've got a date tomorrow when i'm actually just going to the cinema with two girls from the gym 
sobbing at call the midwife. eating mini eggs. #fatforlife 
@ imjmichaels can tou believe that we don’t even have flamin hot cheetos in canada 
in case you missed it: trump is profiting big time by visiting his own properties and the @ gop is bending over to letting him get away with it. so “donating”his salary is a preposterous joke. #maga 
this saddens me. maybe if certain legal good christian american's didn't dress in hoods and hate people of color this wouldn't be an issue. i'm a #liberalchristian who believes in agape as christ taught. i thought you were a better #samaritan 
half of this #metoo nonsense is fake! trump was right, but this got deleted shortly after. 
“i’ve hired foreigners in florida during the prime season – you could not get help,” trump said. “everybody agrees with me on that. they were part-time jobs. you needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, you can't get help in those hot, hot sections of florida.” 
i’m sorry you’ve been misinformed by the msm and our party. too bad you’ve allowed them to hijack your brain. and now you’re sitting on it. you wouldn’t know the truth if it came up to you and introduced itself. #sad. 
lying piece of abuser! he should be in jail not just out of a job. i applaud his wife’s guts for standing up to the wh, @ realdonaldtrump and @ genjohnkelly! they have shown a complete disregard for abuses women questioning her truth! they have no understanding of #metoo 
that was not the question. she had “zero involvement” would have been the correct answer. 
. @ realdonaldtrump condemned 'hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides' in charlottesville sounds like he feels the same way about domestic violence #moron 
prayers for everyone in #parkland, florida, the 18th school shooting so far this year. prayers......until the next senseless shooting..... and the next ..... 
why would they make those doctors do that press conference, you could by the look on their faces they didn't want to do that #parklandshooting 
since @ realdonaldtrump will never do it, happy #valantinesday . i assume even though you sold your soul for money you still have a heart. assume that is. #chainmigration 
a gun orgy in the u.s. & many hope that their children aren't invited to the bloody feast. #upset #disgusted 
white house staffers without permanent security clearances read the top-secret president's daily brief … they may as well read them...cause we know @ realdonaldtrump doesn't, #sad! #resist #theresistance 
it’s time we start protecting these kids on school campuses...with security guards, law enforcement, social screening, metal detectors etc. … 
no big deal in usa! as per nra guidelines just give it a 24-48 hr news cycle all will be forgotten. plan works to perfection just as the family of those 1st graders slaughtered. no gun laws changed and the dead out of news and forgotten. usa!usa!usa! 
when i was younger, i told myself a lot of people are single. a lot of friends were either trapped in a bad marriage, or ended in a bitter divorce. i came real close to marriage a long time ago. hats off to we are all people trying to get by. 
that all 45 can offer is #thoughtsandprayers which mean nothing but empty lip service #guncontrolnow … 
military enlistment, fuck it. all men have to serve two years in hell. serving for their country of course. uhm, my wise words to stop your worrying? none because i am also petrified myself. at least we can all cry together. (2/2) #bts #btsmilitary 
i think the onion must be tweeting this out every third day or so. … 
then do something other than offer prayers, condolences, and hush money to a porn star.

you left out a white american terrorist, had he been middle eastern or black you would have been all over it. 
hate to be bearer of bad news jake, now 17. 
sadly the lunitics are taking over the asylum & the offended spend all of their time trolling to be offended & here is their latest find. 
as parents are we being mindful of the signs of a #sad, #anxious or #unhappy child? don't just tell them suck it up, this is life! listen to their hearts & concerns & stay proactive in their #lives to help them through it. stop look & listen! they are screaming for our 
accused south florida school shooter confessed to rampage that killed 17 people, police say … @ realdonaldtrump you have blood on your hands because of you rolling back obama policy for metal heath people to buy guns 
#truth #hilarious … 
but all you have is a political response yourself, a tired line of no use to anyone since you're not actually going to propose a course of action. what a waste of a potential platform for good! 
my co worker knows this crazy b#tch rt @ ajc: mother indicted on murder charges; her 2 sons found with heads in oven 
not true!! american is not blind ! we see through all the theatrics and it's sad that the dems want step up and get this done ! the loosers in this are the daca kids and it's on you! #sad#doyourjob 
when even @ washingtonpost calls you #fakenews but that's a typical … 
seems like to me this was a trump supporter! this is your making and mess #loserpresident 
the dem's have tried numerous times but the gop who are in nra's pockets do nothing. you are right, it will take something happening to one of their kids/grandkids for them to do anything. 
just watched ( wash up wolf) try to push that- run in the corner and suck your thumb narrative with gov ...that's why !! 
@ realdonaldtrump tweets today that "russia started its anti-us campaign in 2014" & cites that as evidence that he is not guilty of #collusion. #nothingburger there's no reason he needed to be involved in russia's first steps for him to be guilty of collusion. #distracted 
or little bobby hutton, the jackson brothers, geronimo pratt? #blackhistorymonth is a good time to remember #cointelpro. 
that florida school shooting is definitely a tear jerker.

breaking: you are even dumber than you look! … 
aft 5 yrs #twitter locked my acct due to an "automatic" filter triggered when i was posting under #maga hashtag regarding this tragedy. how many other real people had their free speech violated because this company chose to side with liberals & silence conservative voices?

oh gosh. that troubled youth? we were best friends growing up. thick as thieves. then one day after a sleepover my mom started making breakfast for us. he said “pancakes please” but mom was making waffles. he got up, grabbed his jacket and walked home. just like that. #sad! 
getting nervous?? hows that trump brand gonna look after your indictment drops? #resign-now he knows everything! 
he is right, “game changer”, how many more guns would the nra sale under that schema... #sad. 
first of all, learn how to spell and secondly, don’t hate on michelle obama just b/c she has more class and intelligence in her pinky finger than you could ever hope to have. she’s also still doing more for the country than melanie yup... you’re probably a troll

his latest tweet is about his good buddy @ nascar shows you where his priorities lie !!! 
no time for watching tv...always reading documents, so many documents. … 
& now we have a moron who is bored and can't even read one page. 
i'll tell you what. trump is a corrupt sob. has been his entire pathetic life. try turning the channel off fox "news" every once in a while. or do you get your news from alex jones? something is terribly, horribly wrong with you.

i just want to emphatically state f*ck you to every @ gop that has ever taken money from the terrorist organization @ nra. a big f*ck you to every conservative talking head going on tv to blame others & distract while supporting less #guncontrol laws. a huge f*ck you to trump!

i have complete confidence in our attorney general john mitchell. i am confident that they allegations being made will be proven false, and those who started these false allegations will eat their words! #sad! 
yet you were not ashamed of obama who hated america and tried to destroy it from. the inside out. 
was just informed about about the break-in at the watergate hotel. i can't believe anyone would do such a thing! i hope they find out who did this terrible act. #sad!

so many opinions from people who know nothing about guns. do you really think that banning “assault weapons” will stop a criminal from committing a crime. your gun control ideas will only regulate the law abiding public and have no effect on the criminals in our society.

#acmawards the academy, in my opinion, loses credibility when #ericchurch is void of nominations. he is arguably one the 3 best male performers in the world, great song writer, and makes good record after good record. no entertainer nominations? you recycle the same acts.

my favorite nyt article so far. trump leaves washington in chaos. hmm. all congress went home for easter break including all the democrats, potus goes to florida, washington reeling!!! seems it's only you at the nyt are reeling, unable to control the weekends narrative. 
you don't want liberty. you're not able to handle the responsibility that comes with it. you clearly need politicians and know-nothing teenagers to make emotional decisions for you instead. you are a weak american. 240 years ago you'd be known as a british loyalist

yes, manufactured in china. trump has outsourced over 900,000 u.s. jobs since he has been in office. he sucks at business, which is why he is so jealous of bezos. #pathetic 
i finished #love on netflix and now im and #bored 
i love that the best evidence against @ potus is @ potus. you guilty pos you. it's #sad. #impeach cc: @ rnc @ gop @ foxnews why the silence from @ speakerryan and @ senmajldr? #maga #resist 
cqlles the police on javi when he entered his own house & told jo they kept isaac away from javi. this man beats the mother of their son's & she's all ok him being around isaac & linc 
@ scottrogowsky there are 2 things that i will never ever forget that i learned on #hq : 1)the capital of #australia is canberra & 2) bird’s nest soup is made from bird’s nests. #hqtrivia 
#disappointed #familydynamics 
all i see on the news is about your book where you talk about getting gangbanged. 
it’s simple... feds are investigating cohen. this has nothing to do with mueller’s investigation. you know it. hannity knows it. but you’ll beat the drum over and over claiming “overreach!” and trump’s base will froth. #falsenarrative 
matt boyd has given up two runs in 11 innings and will have an 0-2 record to show for it. #tigers #nosupport 
nice summary of what mueller has revealed so far. can we believe trump? if he is so innocent, why is he working so hard to keep facts hidden (as well as his taxes) & threatening to fire mueller. to paraphrase, i fear he doth protest too much. #protectmueller 
only people who actually have a great stereo system with actual speakers know about this. so not that many people anymore. sad #minispeakers #myphoneismystereo #compressedaudio 
i just watched @ hardballchris and can't believe what a douche bag he has become... 
and to think, his first season and, 11 years later, his last season were the only ones where his team made the playoffs. 
lost my white kitkat my fat self is so upset pls help.. even though i have more snacks i was just really looking forward to it #heartbroken #probintheenglishlab 
oh, joni! if republicans voted for it, democrats would make it completely veto-proof. didn't the koch brothers explain about congressional override?? 
i guess since the first poll was such an epic fail, you've set up another with bots to vote yes to get the result you need. 
not a chance they will do anything. … 
while his 4 month old son was at home with his wife. you're literally applauding him for this. 
nobody wants to follow me on twitter!! #alone #theworldhateme 
talentless shills of an unhealthy lifestyle that is envied by millions of children and teens. 
i’m there more for the people that once said they will always be there.. rn i need them and no ones there! 
black people can't be smart. black people can't be ambitious. black people can't thrive. they don’t want to see us do better then them. … 
i agree @ barbrastreisand o went to a city high school in jersey and not once did we ever think about having to wear see thru back packs. our society today has become one in which it feels self entitled with no repercussion for their actions. … 
i can't stand clinton either. the two major candidates in 2016 were scrapings from the very bottom of the barrel. it's a shame, since the gop bench was fantastic. we got stuck with the booby prize. 
i miss diversified farms. 
sports unites people, brews passion and kindles the spirit of community. if anything, it could have brought everyone together #csk 
no no no no.... @ fortnitegame #fortnite 
the nazis' concentration camps said, work sets you free; trump says @ nytimes, @ cnn, and @ washingtonpost are #fakenews. did it? are they? as if the west wing reading wasn't fake enough, @ newyorkpost is the only acceptable "news" for this "president", @ realdonaldtrump . #sad. … 
adios, intern kelly! 
gee, jonathan is facebook a monopoly? lol ! so many dimwits it's 
#shayari in #hindi (download with full hd images) … 
but all we here is poor leigh copping some trolling

i had been wanting to say that my whole life and didn't do it first #jeopardy #collegechampionship #whourootingfor 
look how tiny your hand is, even amongst the tiny hand club! stop trying to make the used car salesman from new jersey circa 1982 "thumbs up" thing cool. it's not. it's weird and fake. like you. ugh. #loser #resign #impeachtrump 
some @ evan_mcmullin guy (who received the same number of 2016 electoral college votes as i did), seems upset. #sad, so 
now you are ripping off @ kingsthings 2 cents? 
no surprises here! says a lot, sad to say, about many of his supporters. one would hope that folks who be more in love with truth and righteousness than someone like #trump who is the antithesis of both! #prayforamerica 
and we'll always have friday. … 
these investigation stories sound like one of a mob boss, not a president 
an embarrassment for the people of my state today watching our disgraceful senators showboat and grandstand on tv. a freakin joke. 
he is only exposed to one side of the story. 
@ realdonaldtrump @ cnnbrk @ abcnews @ cbsnews @ nbcnews @ snlupdate how does it feel to know that the vice is tightening on your administration, and to know you have the most terrible presidential term ever. you have embarrassed the united states to the world! #badpresident

i texted my 22-y-o son, “ . @ arimelber says hi.” he replied, “who’s that?” parenting fail. 
hey @ mikeflynn826, maybe you should take this advice. you started a rumor of why ‘21 julz kost left one of your bluestar events a couple years ago because “she didn’t like that i was giving her advice on her shot”, which was absurd! use as a learning moment please! #rumors 
oh that would be #awesome if you #deleteyouraccount cuz y’all you do his hate. becky is so :( 
yet another trump guy proven to be full of bs. he really did pick nothing but criminals, con-men and low-lifes! #finepeople 
cmon black dudes! everyone knows it's illegal to be black in a white ppl hangout spot, in m'urrica! hell even lebron isn't allowed an opinion. why would y'all think it's ok to just chill out harmlessly at a starbucks like anyone else. #shutupanddribble 
like @olivernorthfnc, libby is still guilty and a traitor to the american people don john @ realdonaldtrump … 
me with all this homework i have this weekend. . . . . . . #homework #college #relatable… 
spoken like a true immature insecure, sad little human. so i guess comey nailed it with his profile of you. 
why don't rich liberals help those they say they care so much about instead of buying powers from politicians? it is a lie to control their peasants! will they ever wake up to the truth?? there should be 0 rich liberals. #hypocrites 
my darling favourite @ dustyraybottoms is out :( #dragrace 
to divert attention away from this, @ realdonaldtrump will probably bomb syria this weekend. 
#mtpdaily @ chucktodd lordy i can't believe you gave @ gopchairwoman free airtime to express faux indignation and promote lyin comey website but not say diddly squat about the liar-in-chief being at 2500+ (and counting). 
and yet you continue to try to obstruct justice to hide it or something related to it. 
someone is wearing their big boy pants today...... #sad. 
looks like our president is having a rough go with puberty 
@ sebgorka @ gop @ realdonaldtrump in an earlier phase of #tinyhands #dementia —- he didn’t believe presidents should react by attacking other countries... during his campaign, he still did not support this behavior. now that he is trying to distract usa from #trumpscandals .. … 
i don’t see anyone with bobble heads and they told me they ran out?? same thing happened last year. #bobbleheadlies #staywoke thunderbirds are not the falcons. #bringbackthefalcons 
15th april and i still have not seen my jacket... am i even gonna get it back? now i start wondering... was supposed to be in gurgaon’s offices since a month already, but when i went there they were not even able to get in touch with their own driver to ask where is it. #sad. … 
poor idiot @ loudobbs must have forgotten to take his dementia meds again. 
....i feel sorry for him....fifty-nine years in prison.....his whole life... … 
minerals & business councils of australia do that very same thing,to get better deal,oops,i mean conditions. in other words they are union. just like ama. or are unions just derogatory term meant only for workers,the working class. so question is,don’t professionals work?! 
i wish you were here with us i would comment with you each one if it's possible 
yasss it's time for a great show lexi: #hurt #done

how can we find hundreds of millions to bomb syria but can’t find pr recovery? 
oh, fakefoxnews. so very 
yes they do @ davidaxelrod however @ realdonaldtrump has never grown beyond piaget’s first level of development ( the child thinks he’s the center of the universe) #toddlerinchief #liarinchief … 
very to hear about this... #rip gunny … 
duh!!!! i could’ve told u that! … 
you tweeting about someone else being “self serving” is definition of ironic 
perhaps they should all just wait until they're convicted and call it a day … 
not ! 
fair point enjoy-here is a gif of truth that is my best tweet of the day! … #muelleriscoming 
when you are excited and counting the minutes and it doesn’t happen! #disappointed #sigh 
wow @ starbucks was this really necessary? maybe someone should have asked a question and not assumed..... … 
what man in what office is he referring to? if he can’t pronounce the books of the bible, i can’t believe that he knows what’s in it or how to pray. 
you really should see a therapist. your obsession with @ realdonaldtrump is #sad. stop the unnecessary hate. #maga 
happy to tell #delta how i am to see how quick they tossed me aside. i look forward to avoiding the delta brand. welcome to #boycottnation. so worth it. 
@ foxnews @ realdonaldtrump … 
i love night court. he was indeed outstanding 
they always say, no news is good news. well, they're right. all the news i am getting today is bad news. 
judge says no to dick tater trump hege … 
i have yet to see this 
grandpa can’t wait any longer 
harry anderson from night court has passed away yall... #nightcourt #nostalgia 
are you seriously using the platform of #potus to shill for a private business while under federal investigation? you are so dumb... #peabrain 
what does uncovering who hannity has used for legal help have to do with russia?? where are @ seanhannity rights as a private citizen with his lawyer gone????? 
mother nature, on april 16th, is in full scrag mode. #yeg #whereisspring

@ rangerholton you are one of the most disgusting humans i’ve ever had the misfortune of coming across. your political views towards guns and your obvious racism is shameful. your bio says “christian.” what a farce! #keepgoing @ rumblefishone @ … 
@ jennabushhager prayers for you and your family. your gammy will never be forgotten! she was a lady of honor, respect and class! rip former first lady barbara bush 
to hear #barbara just passed away. in prayer for the #bushfamily for peace & strength as they mourn her passing. 
how long until trump makes barbara bush's death about him? i'm guessing it will take two tweets. #trumpresign #ripmrsbush 
no 10gbe? such a disappointment. i guess it's not the taichi ultimate then. friday streaming on "a new system"? 
why mess with a successful formula? 
hes hot but idc i want ihtbh actually no lol bc it'll break my heart entirely but i still love it so much and those idiots t... — poor you … 
i’d like to make light of this, but it’s way more than our #police have done. #stillnotenough 
@ drudge_report @ drudge disrespects the bush family by preferring @ nikkihaley vs. white house drama as the main story on his website. #sad. #barbarabush rip 
oooo....ur handpicked *conservative* justice gorsuch voted w/the *liberal* justices. bet u didn't see that coming. better get him in to review his loyalty pledge to u. forget appealing to congress for anything. they've been sitting on their hands for years about immigration. 
as another adams descendant, am crushed. she was the abigail adams of our generation. outspoken, unfiltered, smart & kind. my kind of role model. 
barbara bush died! so there is that! #nocoincidences 
wanna move all the way to australia to get away from this mess that i’m in #australia

my frankie’s food is never the same if it isn’t made by a butwill 
only real losers like @ realdonaldtrump cheat to win & actually feel accomplished about it. he's cheated on his wives. he's cheated on his taxes. he's cheated his lawyers. he's cheated his supporters. he's cheated trump university "students." he's cheated on his diet. 
this is another examples how the u.s. is unfortunately taking the back seat in progress and innovation while other countries are pushing boundaries. by the time the u.s. wakes up it might be late to catch up with the rest. … 
well, your picks have been swampy and a bit white. where’s the diversity? where’s the youth? you’re hurting the american people, you. try taking responsibility for once in your 70 years. afraid? corrupt? #putinspuppet

you don't seem to realize i've been fighting for free speech for everyone, on my campus, on twitter, and in @ quillettem, for longer than you've been a sea monkey. 
getting round donny boy! #presidentpumpkin #cheeseburger 
i’m sure democrats could post... impeach trump though... 
this is pretty damned #sad! 
fun? having their world blown to smithereens around them is "fun" to watch? that's what this boils down to for you @ tedcruz? and, you don't even have enough self-respect to care about the massive humiliation you suffered at @ realdonaldtrump s little twitter hands? 
feel better. i just got over shingles and a cold. seems like i’ve been sick every day for ......how long has tangolini been the #fakepresident?

i can not believe that @ ctvnews had a spot about the good #backpage had for the sex trade & it will be bad for business. not on the horrors of the sex trafficking but on how woman now have to go back to the street. shame on you ctv shame. 
indeed. i am also far from being a tory voter, but i too feel politically homeless at the moment. ironic, since after 44 years in the uk as a 'foreigner' i just got my british citizenship, which grants me a vote at the next ge. but, suddenly, not a clue! #wtflabour #wtfleft 
wish i could feel love like this. #lonely … 
#happy #lifesshort good evening tinged with sadness and fun , when you know that it will be the last weekend you will have together in this world hard to say goodbyes

in all honesty @ ananavarro that grand old party died the day @ realdonaldtrump declared his candidacy. very few of today's #republicans have any honor left. majority of them have aided & abetting trump & his assault on democracy. … 
why do we need to espouse 
trump defends cohen after nyt report @ cnnpolitics this piece of shit called @ realdonaldtrump who is just scared shitless that cohen would flip....that’s all. #sad!? 
@ potus big or small, lies are lies. … 
oh so we are back to that old lie? "he wasn't there" "he didn't know anyone who died". wow nice coming from supposed adults. you people need to evaluate why a teenager brings out this kind of vitriol in you? as your leader says 
while seating next to a true gentleman, @ flotus gives a genuine smile! happier at a funeral than at mar-la-go! …

@ ubisoft hay ubisoft. when is there going to be a fix for the stuck in day/night cycle? we pay just as much for digital download games with the same issues. think a refund is needed for this. or at least a hard copy as a goodwill gesture. so much time with ubi games.

more importantly, why didn’t @ realdonaldtrump tweet about: the white gunman who killed 4 minorities at waffle house, or james shaw, the black man who disarmed the shooter and saved countless lives?

wow! i just watched a moron trump rally in michigan on tv. he ranted and raved to his base. he went on and on about how it’s everyone else’s fault. what bothers me is, his supporters eat it all up. it’s frightening that people can’t see through his lies and complete bullshit!

@ cnnpolitics @ parisdennard is a sycophant joker. how he can totally embrace trumpno matter what..., is beyond me. he is blind to the white supremacy trumphas woken up & that his bro-nazis would lynch him if they could.

so far today the only folks i've seen referring to the @ presssec as "fat" are trump supporters and hack reporters. michelle wolf said nothing about her weight. so the #maga people are spending the day disgracefully fat-shaming someone while simultaneously condemning it. 
yet you look happy af to meet him in this picture 
i remember we use to “lean wit it rock wit it”...now this generation doin leanwit a rock in it 
why do good people have to suffer whereas bad people with dark twisted minds keep enjoying their lives. life is unfair sometimes. 
are you a total goob if you shed a tear because you can never really work at dunder mifflin? asking for a friend.. 
dennis miller going full wimpy with the “i’d glady pay you tuesday for a hamburger today” joke approach has everyone on twitter roasting the shit out of him, and deservedly so. … 
what the hell is the straight delicious snack. i thought i was buying twisties. not a single twist to it #straighties @ pepsico @ 
have you seen msm lately? they tell us what they want us to hear, not the unbias truth. 
wow, 4 days to think of a come back. really dennis? 
"nuh-uh, you are"? that's all you have to offer the world? #andprettyfuckingfunnytoo 
michelle wolf has no class. this is a war on conservative women. #disgraceful behavior by the liberal nut jobs. mean spirited, nasty attacks. shameful indeed. 
this one is my favorite:( im … 
wow, after what, 20 years, you crawl out from under a rock to personally attack another comic? maybe you should watch her @ hbo special first. did you also forget what a roast is? been out of work/out of touch that long. i'm 60 & know who @ michelleisawolf is & her shows 
i agree 100% why would any person want to be in a political party that did such horrible things of the past?. still today the dems oppress people to be co-dependent on the gov't where they can control with power. this is the same thing of the past. 
sooo the @ gop gets mad at a joke made by a comedian, but not at the republican prez cozying up with putin.... #pathetic 
what a disgrace that kathy griifin used your show @ theview to take back her apology for her egregious picture. the ladies denounced it when it happened, even rosie o’donnell denounced it. you’re normalizing a hate mongering person that disgusted most the world not just usa. 
if you try to do your work as a journalist and you interview someone of the $ bch community... $ btc trolls will try to #censor you... … 
i just want to cry watching this... … 
like your friends @ morningmika or @ mitchellreports? both failed to mention the last line in @ michelleisawolf's #horrificact on saturday- flint still doesn't have clean water. i'm assuming this is a polite way to call them out. you're kinder than i. it really was #pathetic 
it was'nt a roast however she turned it into one. she was suppose to be a comedian only other than a very tasteless abortion joke which in my opionin was way out of line. i dont see dead babies as a joke in any manor and its sad that we as a society has sunk to that level 
trump you could of had your wall - the dems caved and said they’d fund it, for a deal on dreamers - you turned it down - you screwed the pooch - now you’ll never ever ever get that wall. #weak #notgettingthewall 
damn that quote is so bad it froze and crashed my podcast app in the middle of the ben shapiro show 
#trump is truly 
and it’s even more unfortunate that they don’t say it aloud! they’re as guilty as trump is for destroying our democracy! true patriots would end this nightmare! … 
jay cutler has no job and is now forced to live in other people cars. 
trump - you have to be the worst mob boss in history - kelly just punked you and you do nothing when you go to prison - kelly will trade you out for smokes #weak #pathetic #shitholemobboss 
i thought it was ‘free pizza monday’ at the cathedral... where is everyone? #wronged #cruel 
kanye called slavery a “choice”.... i can’t sorry man i’m done! a windy city boy lost his jumpsuit today... #day #for #yezzus 
so incredibly tone deaf it’s almost impressive. there is no sensitivity because there is no empathy in the administration whatsoever. forget empathy, even just as pr this is a terrible decision. 
and who should be surprised by this admission, no one. @ realdonaldtrump is walking, talking fake news. 
@ hardball has turned into a game show. @ hardballchris #idiot

we should be better than this. what do we need? more education? responsive govt.? police who believe? stronger laws? obviously a country wide convo about misogyny would be a start. #shameful 
but we still cannot adequately fund public education...

@ glaad stopped being a force for good when they started shilling for a political party rather than the people they claim to protect. this has happened to many groups that began with a noble cause, but have debased themselves to the point of all sounding the same. … 
didn’t you have an affair with anthony wiener? trouble is lefties have no dignity or shame

i also was enjoying chance’s music too. 
of course not. because all roads lead to @ barackobama , @ comey ,& @ hillaryclinton . to expose 1 is to expose all & it'll never come to light, unfortunately. killary will never face a jury. the @ thedemocrats will do anything to even provoke a war w #russia to hide their lies. 
it’s mental illness, going on two years. it’d be funny if it wasn’t so truly, pathetically #sad.

dylan this fired up cause his dream of touching the rim was crushed when he was white and 5'11. … 
there will be a tiny paragraph in the history books about him being mayor during 9/11 and pages of his treason and collusion with #trumprussia, he will be disgraced 
#splatoon2 #nintendoswitch #lag yeah. . . ok 
@ presssec what are you going to say to your kids when they grow up & find out how much you lied to everybody all the time?are they going to look at you and say mom were you lying to us then about values,honesty,god & trust? it's really a shame what you're doing 
that’s what you tweet when we’re losing the game?

@ realdonaldtrump don’t read, he has no idea about anything. … 
i think this kind of behavior towards kanye west is a disgrace. kanye can choose who he votes for, he has a choice. it's time for the african americans to think for themselves and get off that democrat plantation its not 1860s anymore.

psa: trump wasn't born in the us. no wonder he refuses to release any personal info of himself and why he just had men raid his drs office this last week. he had his real birth certificate! don't let the fake truth media win! @ billmaher @ realdonaldtrump #fakenewsmedia 
just more fake news from the white house communications office. 
seriously. it's a trump tactic - repeat a lie loudly and often enough, and maybe it'll become true. it's not working. he's just making himself look worse and worse with every tweet.

he who gotchas last, gotchas best. your kids will be old enough to read your twitter bullshit one day. 
written in the obama era, it's an old pamphlet everyone had seen for years. trump humiliated her on purpose, they also humiliated #melania w/ #sessions announcing ripping children from parents legally on the mexican border an hour after melania's speech.

i could be wrong, but i think b lost a ball under the couch. #help 
states the guy across the big puddle! i get it, i'm canadian. you & i don't have this carnage happening in our schools bcuz we have sensible gun control.heaven forbid anyone, including sensible americans, point out lives are more impt than the 2a. they always have a retort. 
nine people were murdered in yet another school shooting and yet it was reported as one of the last stories on the nightly news because of how desensitized we've become to them. #trumpsamerica #maga 
this is so we are in the week 20th..!! 
that’s not technically true: if your kids get shot, that means someone bought a gun and a bullet - these two things make @ realdonaldtrump very happy. if you meant he doesn’t care about your kid, then you’re absolutely right and that’s fucking … 
@ theellenshow did you know it'salmost been 20 years since mathew sheppard #lgbt 
@ realdonaldtrump no one is framing you. you treasonous coward. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. you are guilty. 
the same 20% dumb fucks that throw their litter down or dump a shitty diaper on the ground in a parking lot. or set fireworks off in a dry field, complain about people being on welfare while collecting it themselves. the same dimwits that text & drive. i could go on and on. 
and he can see two sons who were raised with respect, humility and dignity. respected and loved by so many. true royalty. unlike his i won’t even bother you know what i mean. 
@ realdonaldtrump if you don't make a change, the people will! #realnews 
ok, seriously? youtube has a huuuge problem recommending me videos with spoilers in the title and thumbnails. i’ve watched maybe 3 god of war related videos in an effort to keep it low, but i just got eye-punched with a big spoiler while watching an unrelated music video. 
idk why but i have been feeling really lonely bc i feel like nobody ever will love me even if i try to be nice #viral #loney

how about demanding gun control or something for us citizens? the only time i’ve seen you demand anything is specifically for you. do you realize what a narcissist you are? you aren’t looking out for americans. you’re looking out for donald trump.

@ jakewim the bias you have against lsu is palpable. i understand it though. you being a mississippian/ole miss/msu native, alumni or just fan and being under the thumb of lsu for the better part of 4 decades. so, when one perceives a weakness at lsu you pounce. 
sometimes i want to understand and sometimes i just don’t see the point cause i already know. #upset #cry #frustrated 
anyone notice how anytime anyone does anything the folks on the right disapprove of it is an illegal act and they should be locked up? #pathetic

it is absolutely perplexing. we’re all that stands between a president and an autocrat. … 
the president of the united states has ordered the doj & fbi to hold a partisan briefing to give his allies in congress the information he wants! no democrats allowed! how is this not a gross abuse of power? yet frank lobiondo contends our democracy isn't being destroyed!

thank you for lying to the american public on a daily. you're (not) amazing. actually, you're quite an incompetent, ineffective, and impotent unethical "leader". 
so to you calling nfl players that chose to kneel sob's is winning? ever wonder how their mothers felt?

as do i that you think trump has drained any swamp. america is dying as you sit back and think he is draining the swamp. 
@ jim_jordan never realized how short you were until i saw you eye-to-eye with @ alexwagner on @ sho_thecircus is all of your anger and hostility a result of over compensating for your diminutive stature. as your boss says;

@ dorindamedley she obviously has a problem. she won’t admit it, most addict don’t. i really emphasize with her but i to had to cut people off because i’d such behavior! 
@ presssec if being called a liar bothers you then stop lying for trump! you are trump's mouthpiece to america. you lie every single day that you get in front of the microphone, and you do it knowingly! god will judge you harshly for your sins. #worstchristianever #liarsarah 
hey . @ nfl - you know you don't really have a team when half of them go outside and stand for their country and the other half sit in the locker room and sulk because they can't disrupt the game and piss people off. they need to be fired! not coddled! 
it takes thought to unfriend someone pure haters 
i will send my thoughts and prayers to you tim. 
@ realdonaldtrump wow! north korea really played you like a fiddle. how embarrassing for you! you really believed they would just give up their nukes?!

@ realdonaldtrump biggest problem negotiating with leaders of other countries, aside from being painfully ignorant, and ill-informed, is he has no core values, and assumes they don't either. and when they aren't intimidated by him, he blinks. every. damn. time. … 
there's a deep well of stupidity, ignorance a gullibility in this country. that's for sure

i'm a bit sad that the summit with north korea dissolved. i didn't care that @ realdonaldtrump would broker the deal, i just wanted to see something go right, for a veil of threats and fear to be lifted. this was a chance at peace and now we are back to the flexing contest.

nah you’re just wrong. plus now everyone knows you’re an idiot. #gop #traitors 
way back during desert storm, i used to see all these goddamn gmc truckasaurus wrecks ford excrement xls driving around with "support our troops" stickers on the ass end. we americans have a real hard time with connections, causes, and effects. … 
agreed, @ gop and #anti-american 
sure...h2b is an end-around to free market economics. golf courses are notoriously low paying jobs. h2b says: "i am not willing to pay the prevailing wage, so let's import immigrants at minimum or below minimum wage." it's laughable, except it's not. it's corporate welfare. 
so you say you're not very american, do not give a shit about american values, and as a trump supporter you also have a whole lotta hate in your head for black folks. well, that's just 
wow. people cheering that they have the right to abort babies. #heartbreaking

roseanne apologised kathy on the other hand doubled down on her garbage so called "joke" and played the victim. 
so sad that vjk blocked me. 
it's some super messy niggas out here 
time to go the way of old yeller... 
yes, they’re good ( @ ebgamescanada) at taking our money, but can’t answer basic questions about their products. 
thats the problem media hide all the crime from the obama administration.

this one is a lost cause, let him burry himself in ignorance and left wing stupidity #looneyleft #sheeple 
if you are a minister why don't you care at all about this filthy, lying amoral president? he is anathema to everything your faith stands for. you hate democrats so much that you are willing to sell your soul? just for the "thrill" of bashing people on twitter? 
only when you make gluten-free ones. it had been 8 years since i've had a donut. 
aww, someone butthurt?? 
ive watched your show since i was literally a baby. i know you’re not racist. youve had so many equality examples written into your show and its outrageous that a comment (that was wrong) is going to destroy everything the cast of #roseanne has worked so hard to achieve.

@ tgowdysc is a djt sycophant trying to redeem himself from his despicable performance in the strzok hearing, not to mention benghazi. he used to be a respected prosecutor 
the fact that you failed to mention andrew jackson, the vile pos all tribes would agree ws biggest factor in the genocide of natives, is a sad commentary on someone who is a supposed champion of natives. but those damn sioux though right? 
it’s so sad how bad @ wwe is ruining @ wweasuka #smh if you are in @ wwenxt trust me stay there don’t go to the #mainroster your character will be ruined.

dear trumpchumps: your president committed treason today. look up the definition. he is no patriot. he chose putin over the united states of america. how's that for maga? #sad!

unfortunately not. didn’t look into it all until this afternoon. 
@ newtgingrich what happened to you today!! 
jeez brit. think it through for a minute before you fire off a tweet 
1/2 very disturbed at new email @ senfeinstein campaign. remember when they asked trump if he would accept the results? this smacks of sore loser & is what we might expect from a newcomer, but a 25yr incmbnt couldn't even get 50%. yeah blame the eboard? 
yes..russia has always & will always meddle in other countries elections... just as we do, putin unveils truth about dnc, hillary, fbi ... & you want to say trump failed... #comical 
even if a lie is printed to look like a newspaper article it does not make it true. your fake news is getting old. 
interesting that some american including @ realdonaldtrump are more willing to believe putin over multiple us agencies 
you have no idea who strzok is or how much america owes him, do you? never even looked him up, have you? 
..troubling.. blah blah.. yadda yadda yadda. strangely, rob is an actual sitting senator that can actually do something rather than releasing such a milquetoast tweet, but that would require some kind of spine and representation for the people, not his master or donors.

it is un-american for republicans to have taken this long to speak out. i'm looking at you, @ jerrymoran and @ patroberts. just kidding! roberts' statement was generic bullshit. sadly, he still refuses to grow a spine, even for democracy. …

"nice?" you invited putin to our wh. putin arranges assassinations of people who oppose him, but you thought his offer to investigate himself was "great." as for kim, you threatened to annihilate his country, but then you caved, just like with putin. that's not tough enough.

you left off one very significant detail from your boss-stroking tweet. he did all of this on twitter. when he is with a ruthless leader in person (putin and jong-un) he is passive and deferential, but when he’s on twitter and has the caps lock key going— look out!!

i follow jesus christ and he is definitely the right one to follow. is trump your shepard? and i did not attack, only stated an observation from the last trump rally the other night. it was a sad, sad sight. especially the mother holding up her baby and the woman in plaid. 
do you think trump has a drivers license? i don't care. when is the last time he drove a car? i don't care. when was the last time he pumped gas? i don't care. when was the last time he went to walgreens' or walmart? i don't care. these questions reveal your jealousy.

not to mention the decline of metaxas himself… … 
this is the biggest scandal to ever hit dc. democrats actually conspiring to fix an election and when that didn’t work they continued to conspire to take an elected president out. #spygate #obamagate #maga! 
this type of thing is too prevalent in social media. i've had #imposters claim to be @ scottgrimes & @ sethmacfarlane sliding into my dms. it makes you wonder what is so lacking in their lives that they have to pretend to be someone else? #pathetic 
that feeling when all your friends forgot about your birthday but it’s summer so you forgive them. then a month later another kid has birthday and suddenly everybody knows. #reality 
also my therapist broke up with me today, we almost hit a year. he's too expensive for me now. 
#fakenews i mean @ foxnews is covering the trump really on both of their channels. talk about propaganda! meanwhile no mention of the real need today- #cohenpleadeal or #manaforttrial so much for being news outlets. 
"mund stated president trump was wrong to pull out of the paris climate accord." there is is no greater hardship on 3rd world countries than carbon tax. it condemns the poor to pay for the very air. a tax that strains the impoverished beyond their means of survival. 
as long as congress cedes the oversight role, trump gets away with anything and everything. #weak 
if it stops i have one request for season 12:" fix. the #elevator ." #fta but let's be serious for a moment; #bigbangtheory wil stop after s12. so to hear this. …

its hillary.. pence and paul ryan are now full time staff in the white house residence serving cocktails and canapés. 
@ senschumer you have violent backers chuckles … 
why is it when someone else gets in a relationship they completely forget you exist. love shouldn't make you forget family and friends. making decisions that changes their life forever when you don't allow them to have choice is bullshit. #ghost #angry 
how are you coping with all this winning? sick of it yet? asking for a friend! 
in the trump #whitehouse all you have be is blond. trump's pick for consumer agency, backed by gop, 'has no qualifications for this job' …

poor duncan is going to have to pay for his kids' school lunches now. 
i’m over here reading this tweet thinking “i’ve never even been to the cheesecake factory!” 
ah, i was trying to give you some love but you revealed yourself. osama? now i’m back to you thinking you’re a bigot and your community wasn’t served well while you had your badge. 
more proof that solidifies the indisputable fact that liberalism is a mental disorder. #sad! 
i have lost all respect for @ geraldorivera after seeing this. he is using the same 4am talking points as the rest of msm..... 
i just did a little research and ohmygawd literally about 10% of nh's population is a minority. apparently white northeast liberals who rarely see minorities are the people to trust with america's future. 
he's not going anywhere 
i am speechless when someone tells me they've never seen the movie.

so true. @ gop when are you going to #wakeup . how can you accept this immoral activity; especially from your @ potus … 
ms . @ ananavarro #45’s not empathic enough, human enough to care about any1 else but himself. if any story gives credit/homage to another, he feels envy, jealousy, bitterness. he’s brought this all upon himself, the world doesn’t revolve around him. 
is this possibly the last classy republican? @ lindseygrahamsc, i used to think you were of that ilk too. even as a "liberal" i always dreamed of having a drink and watching a derby with you and just having a good, non political time. …

you love to create smoke screens to hide the truth. #sad#almostover … 
#exactly .... thus the reason this was never an issue or thought with @ barackobama and his 8 years of bringing america from economic disaster to great prosperity. i'm old enough to remember when civility, dignity & morals ruled the day. now... not the case at all. – bei arlington, tx 
wow my #facebook is blowing up with posts from friends against #trump. so far not one in agreement that he's doing anything right these days. the mccain criticism, associates running to the hills to get away from his taint. and he still praises himself. over and over...

you know what's sad? you are so pitiful that you continuously lie like this. the economy is not booming. it's on the verge of bombing. you like to take credit for the good things obama did but you never take credit for your screw ups. #blacksagainsttrump 
so now it’s time to be #bad 
thanks, obama! whiny baby don-don grows more desperate for support every day while mueller closes in. 
i think the world of dr, bill, but this was pure tripe! …

the unbelievable hubris of kelli ward who assumed the "timing" of the announcement that john mccain was discontining treatment to "hurt her campaign." another revolting trump clone. … 
instead of a ‘come to jesus’ moment, @ lindseygrahamsc had a ‘come to putin’ moment! … 
he likes to bring up shit about other people to divert attention from him. it’s always obama or hillary. 
she is #disgusting & #pathetic... she is @ gop 
instead of politicing deaths like @ breitbartnews does constantly (mollie tibbetts), @ tedlieu is calling for much needed gun control. stop politicizing deaths and do something instead of spewing lies & propaganda for money.

more fake news from the trump consortium! 
wow @ realdonaldtrump had to be pressured by the american legion in addition to a majority of americans?. he is like a constant dark rainy cloud looming over us... he is so unfit.. it’s mind boggling & disturbing that we have a evil dictator as president. 
our wishy-washy #gop leadership in the wh doesn't act with character. #dangerous #unamerican 
just watched a lot of unboxing videos to punish myself 
he's got to the stage where the soccer press just laugh at him now and openly bait him with questions designed to provoke him …

yassssss!!!! you must have so many insecurities to tan like you do. really man? #sad! #yuge!!!! 
@ repmcsally your bashing of another female (sinema) is pathetic. the fact you are a person of the military and doing this is even worse. oh and now you agree with trump? 
it is u fortanate that some people are guilty until proven innocent. 
the use of the term 'it' factor mattered when no one knew how to x and o break down pro sports. @ mcuban gave you a very important and embarrassing national tv lesson on this a few years ago. i guess your cliche commentary still continues. 
hahahaha. he was in a band. if votes were like records he’d be triple platinum in november. man, you guys are desperate. … 
jesus. @ hawleymo is actually using footage of traitor @ realdonaldtrump in ads against claire. disgusting. though, glad he is using the idiot. we know what he's about.

the fact that it seems as though most liberals are more saddened by the passing of #johnmccain than conservatives is telling. trump has ruined them. 
this needs to gain more attention! i hear people say he is good on the economy...the only economy @ realdonaldtrump understands is that of the 1% and his rich friends! gas prices have been consistently on the rise since january 20 2017! … 
look at all the desperate racists. 
great fight from kiki but it wasn’t enough to get the win today. from 3-1 30-00 she suddenly lost a bit her groove. ## sad #soclose

his last name is trump which rhymes with dumb....they don’t read, they don’t learn, they have zero idea about statistics and definitely nothing on science, hence they have to lie and make up things!? #lockthemallup

quite possibly the douchiest thing you've ever posted, "mr president" #pettylittleman #stillnoclass #weak 
learn to tell the difference between "it's" and "its". snowflake? is that the best you can do? 
wow i am so disappointed @ c_mulroney i expected you to be on the side of democracy not autocrats. a principle is only a principle until it costs you something 
typical..it's reached the point where, one might as well assume the opposite of whatever he says on #twitter. #bigly #sad. 
so what? you want us to listen to a literate & educated man like #obama. cause this is what you sound like. #illiteratetrump

trump is like a high functioning adult with asperger's syndrone: he is unable to read social cues/has impaired social reactions/cannot read facial expressions. 
wow, looks like you had to incorporate your burner account to try and twist the narrative. 
@ realdonaldtrump death toll in puerto rico up from your 16 deaths to 3000. i guess you failed math @ wharton.your @ bounty response was #worsethankatrina, "believe me"! san juan mayor slams trump for touting puerto rico hurricane response as a … 
i think they are working under the “current commander and chief” model. we all need to be a tough more ignorant to fully appreciate the greatness. #protectpubliceducation 
i love the men and women in blue and fully support them but this is wrong. unless other facts are brought to light there is no excuse for shooting a person in their own home without reason. wrong is wrong no matter who does it or the excuse for doing it. 
:( 
lol. you support a man who endorsed a pedophile. who sexually assaulted 20+ women. who created on every wife he's ever had. who called publicly for the murder of civilians in war. and i'm sick? hope you get better soon, miss cleo. 
the grammar in this post clearly identifies a trump supporter... 
" petulance ... " #poorloser 
fyi. don't forget that more than 90 countries lost citizens in the attacks, including the united kingdom (67 deaths), the dominican republic (47 deaths), and india (41 deaths). canada had 24 deaths. real presidents would have included the other countries, but no, not you.

the real world is not apples to apples. #irl #realworld #minority 
so your saying you’d rather live in a bubble? this is why trumps potus...people like you who are uniformed & think it’d be really cool to have a reality tv star as president. #goodgrief 
you need no help from the democrats to look as bad as you are. 
@ speakerryan i would have thought it inconceivable that someone could show less empathy to puerto rico than that asshat we have in the white house, but you are right up there with him. 
i can’t believe this! right in my backyard! that is why i only listen or view to @ msnbc

wow, you're down to citing geraldo as a defense? #baby 
bullshit winners on #worldofdance this was clearly based on a political agenda and not dancing. those kids didn’t “dance” in their final dance, merely made a couple judges cry based on the current political climate regarding vets and homlessness. 
because he’s guilty. 
what an insensitive comment to make! 
some women are so willing to keep a man, to the point of giving up everything in their lives away. as in family, friends, pets, job ect .. just to keep one single half of a man.. 
who is the more useless ? my life or my happiness ? 
wow, they really don’t look happy at all, do they? you’d never guess they just had a baby 
stand your ground bro (ladies included). not enough people do. once you compromise, you are comprised. i wonder if people teach their kids to speak like trump or to disrespect women or disrespect vets or disabled or poor people or immigrants or..... like trump has? 
you’re a #troll and sad and negative. have you ever even driven a @ tesla? why such a hater? don’t like other people being successful and happy? the world is awesome. i suggest you see it. #bethechange

i'm pretty accustomed to social media, but remain shocked by some conversations on it. it's unfathomable how blinded some folks are by one position they're incapable of actual open discussion. never thought i would quote trump, but, is all that comes to mind. 
double decker sucks and i srsly watch it just to see what sunrise has invested money in. #doubledecker

i used to think "we" [ #republicans & #democrats] were all americans just w/ different ideas. sadly, the truth is democrats will do any underhanded thing to get their way. to lie, cheat, steal, assault, undermine, incite, & circumvent our republic is now their norm 
@ wandasmith_atl what type of household do you have what are you teaching by this do you know what you set your family up for

delusionally 
@ realdonaldtrump talks about “fake news”. there is no such thing unless you’re watching @ foxnews making up faux outrage over #potus hugging a #hurricaneflorence victim citing two random tweets from no ones as their citation for the fake story. #failingfox 
this is so gross.

i know this is but everytime i hear a story about someone at taylor’s house i cry a little bit help my sad soul @ taylornation13 @ taylorswift13 
tough political voice to believe when the pundit only listens to one side of any political discussion. if what this man portrays was what anyone believed then democracy would be dead. being a “social warrior” means you have to portray equality for all, this person doesn’t.

i’m not surprised with your beliefs, you still support someone who in his own words “...you can do anything, grab them by the puy”, why would you believe that a sexual abuse victim deserves an independent investigation. 
the #left are #pathetic people they need to … 
the sad part is ford is a victim of the democrats who are using her until they no longer need her then they’ll drop her like a hot mess. i believe she did get abused then something convinced her to use that to derail the kavanaugh nomination.

the republicans don’t care about the truth, if they did, they’d reopen an fbi investigation into the allegations against kavanaugh. they don’t want to know the truth, they don’t want to hear the truth, they don’t want to see the truth, and they don’t want to speak the truth.

what a train wreck. 
wish the cameraman had just reached around and started groping her girls. i’m guessing all of a sudden it would be a big deal. this attitude is what is wrong with society and her teenage girls agreeing it’s ok to be groped is not ok.

mainly because your refs can’t spot a ball correctly even with video review , so pathetic, don’t worry the letter released next week will make it right #nfl #rigged 
it is so sad to watch you leave again! i can’t remember your hugs anymore #crypretty 
these tax increases will chase away investment and existing businesses will see downsizing as a rational course of action. cost of living will go higher and so will unemployment levels. the government needs to rethink the sustainable... … 
the red maga hats did not turn “king coal” around... so the hillbilly riders on the trump train will have to wait! @ realdonaldtrump #shame … 
you know your programs at a low right now when you show up on mnf “c’mon man” 
my mom left me with out gas so i’m stranded waiting for her 
damn justin. you are so deep in the liberal swamp you can’t see facts. check your 401k for illegal ill gotten gains. lol 
the demtards say and do anything to promote hate and fear. 
how much did you get paid for this one? some people will do anything for money 
that would be a moot point for the liberals because there's not a blemish on his record. they only support what they cannot prove. … 
he has yet to publicly apologize to his wife, whom he publicly humiliated. i agree with you, he owes that reporter an apology, she wont get it. 
@ chipotletweets put an thru the app and when i arrived to pick it up no one had an idea what i was talking about. it wasn’t ready. they had to looked for the order and had to wait for them to make it. where’s the convenience for using the app?! #disappointed

such a frail little guy. 
i’m feeling rather 
who's upset?at first i thought you were comparing @ realdonaldtrump to suddam hussein commenting on a stranger's comment as if you know me shows your stupidity. i could be 70something yrs old like trump for all you know. cheering for an elderly insecure man #trumprally 
sounds about right 
yeah, i'm rapidly losing faith in her. 
we can watch it but it keeps buffering. then we a hear a little & it stops to buffer. then we hear it then it buffers. it's very distracting. so maybe it's my phone. i don't know. we pay all this money for @ centurylink & can't even watch our president. 
why don’t the @ cubs have @ barstoolbigcat singing the national anthem..? do they not realize he’s the song bird of our generation 
no 80's horror director would have dared use music like this anywhere in their films. they'd have used skid row before slayer. film people have incredibly mainstream taste in music. …

it’s crazy, right? my followers love it when i bash dr. ford for letting us know that brett kavanaugh got sexually aggressive with her at age 15. maybe they really are deplorable...or at least insensitive sexist pigs. i guess if you drink too much, but still deny, it’s ok. 
jeez, the opioid problem in your state is worse than i thought, you people are so drugged up it’s given you an inflated and undeserved sense of self worth. let’s not forget how this all started...you couldn’t work out some nuanced humor on a jaws parody twitter account. 
qanoners cheer trump’s text alert test, see it as a step towards martial law #lol … 
he reminds me of a loner that finally got an invite to hang with the popular group. desperate to be invited to play golf, and handle the petty crimes and drive-by errands for the gang leader. it’s a sad spectacle. i can’t believe this guy was best friends with mccain. 
. @ realdonaldtrump how can you expect anyone in the world to fear us when our "leader" is a little daddies boy pussy who's never earned anything in his life? what a loser! great job #trumpbase great job, sucks youre this easily fooled, then again, you do fall for allot #maga 
he won't be happy until he controls all of palestine, which probably sets the stage for israel's destruction in the future. and #shortsighted. netanyahu wants peace with arabs, not palestinians via @ almonitor

@ presssec “he was just stating facts?! (about trump mocking dr. ford). seriously, how do you look at yourself in the mirror? how do you sleep at night? how do you support the people who stood at that rally and laughed with him?! #kavanaugh 
and yet you apparently keep reading her tweets so you can interact with @ kathygriffin and be relevant. 
ugh thank u but i seriously have no new clothes, ive been saving up and haven’t went shopping so im deadass wearing leggings, a shirt & a jean jacket lmaoooo 
wow..no more eddie in the yard? been reading from up here in “red sox nation” and it was a great way to stay connected with the team through good and bad. thank you and good luck in tampa! 
why in the hell does trump still do rallies???? he can’t do a press conference but can rant on and on at rallies where participants are being paid. 
how very patriarchal of you scared of two little words? guessing you're a republican, libertarian, conservative who doesn't know enough to vote for your financial benefit. #bigly #ilikebeer #doyoulikebeer 
he’s a lying,crude pig. what’s so sad are the people shown behind him at these rallies cheering and chanting his despicable behavior. we have hit rock bottom as a nation. trump cares for no one but himself. he only wants kavanaugh to protect him from impeachment. #sad. 
no proof she lied. there is proof however that #kavanaugh lied multiple times... and i'm not talking about sexual assault allegations. you are clearly republican first and american second or wherever that is on the list. 
clearly he has never needed an uber after an exciting evening at chilis

@ jeffflake you said on national tv if #kavanaugh lied you would #voteno !! you are a lying coward!! everybody heard you say it and heard him lie!! #badtemperment you know damn well he did it! he lies and steals. i'm sure he's mean to his wife!! !!

politely disagree with the kavenough appointment and this can happen to you too. 
if only the #maga supporters who watch @ foxnews were told of this reality. they have no idea how this country really is right now … 
how can republicans make the insane rhetorical argument to say that kavanaugh's accuser has been assaulted by anyone but @ brettkavanaugh, regardless of her testimony? has american republicans fell into immorality? @ realdonaldtrump 
feminism is a floppy disc, outdated and useless, the modern feminist is like a floppy disc saleswoman who won't accept her career is over. still trying to sell a product nobody needs nor wants. a one sided disc for lunatics who think half the human race is evil.

mom is petting @ ziggy57879040, which means she does not love me! #corgi 
@ realdonaldtrump you do not speak on behalf of the nation! you speak on behalf of your base. the world i live in, people are angry as hell that you're tearing america apart. you love money and power, probably the only things you ever truly loved. i pity you. 
my @ chipotletweets burrito got shred to smithereens after the first bite

i forgot my laptop charger extension. i just walked 30 mins to this study spot 
great example. lying conman accused of sexual assault by 20 women plays the pity card for a lying-under-oath judge accused of sexual assault by several women (after seeing what happened to #christineblaseyford nobody else will come forward) #illegitimatepresident & #scotus … 
sigh... the golden age of #mtv from music video giants to a cesspool of fake reality tv. 
their relentless animus to grab all the possible bucks out there is nothing short of demented they have no pride as they embark on this burlesque tour 
they talking out of their asses to make themselves feel better about losing a 20pt lead haha. 
whaaaat? say it ain't so.. all those wins still cant support their team? … 
this... and then also... those comments. that is an 18 year old kid talking. that is someone who is being raised in america. that is someone young girls have to encounter. #nokavanaugh 
it’s because they don’t know any better. 
@ realdonaldtrump ahhhh!!!! conalld!!!! so this is why dear nikki resigned. she’s been doing a tom price!!!! its all beginning to make sense. you tried to get ahead of the story right??? another #bigfail … 
because you are furious that the world does not embrace your love of trump. 
the @ gop finds that if you make the #trumpcult afraid of something they will vote. they made them afraid of mexicans and locked up babies. they made them afraid of hillary and they're still shouting to lock her up. 2018 - it's the mob! there will be mobs! lock up the mobs. 
what i don’t understand is how people love dick riding! everybody wanna win but don’t wanna put in no work! for example niggas rather ride the bench at central and go to state then play at a sorry school start and put up numbers to go to college #sad! 
no exclusive mini-column this week! rrreeeeeeeee! 
crazy to think you can fool us fans to think this season is okay! there are no highlights when you’re losing, 1-4 probably one of the worst teams in the @ nfl right now! but still #r4l #raidernation

actually he votes very conservatively and is far more conservative and principled than you or your friend donald. what he says about you is true. if trump actually shot someone on 5th avenue you'd find a way to blame hillary.

pretty pathetic that you can’t appreciate progress in scientific advancement for the betterment of the human race. hopefully the android overlords treat you harshly when it’s their time to take control.

the pumpkin pies at mcdonald’s are surprisingly awful 
insults are the last resort of insecure people with a crumbling position trying to appear confident. they often come in the form of the individual’s projection of what they hate or are guilty of themselves. 
it’s already had what i believe you be your desired effect 
sanders, like her boss, is a fraud. a charlatan pretending to be a professional. she purges a little bit of her soul everytime she stands up and lies to the whole world. at some point, i had hoped someone would tell her to save herself, but no one must care enough. 
a vivid exhibition of the state of civics education in american schools.

i won’t insult our children by calling him childish - he’s just not a mature, thinking, nor fully formed human. 
for me i use my light box and my dawn stimulator so my room is bright when i wake up. it makes my life easier and keeps up my energy levels #vitamind #stress 
i've been a long time (years) customer of @ midtowncomics. my pull list is around $500 a month, more with preview orders. they shipped a $25o order spine down then gave me a rigid, antiquated, time consuming rigamarole of a return policy and then stonewalled me. buyer beware! 
sitting with his president (,putin)and cleaning the dingleberrys from his arse!!!

@ jenniferjjacobs @ jaketapper @ realdonaldtrump having driven on those same roads a number of times, and to belleau wood, this is fake news. there would have been no problem driving there. trump was just too lazy and it wasn’t about him. #lowenergy 
there is no defense for any leader tweeting that rant as a response to the hell that people are currently enduring, period. 
that's how iq45 starts each day and it usually getting worse as the day goes by! 
feeling the winter transition and it's getting you down? read our newest article below. #hercampus … 
discovered on facebook: smart, compassionate, normal democrats who are sleep induced by cnn. 
my dad fought in korea. many stories of soldiers nearly freezing to death, living outside all winter, as they fought to defend the korean people. he must be rolling in his grave, thinking of a #potus who is scared of a little drizzle. #remembranceday … 
and the other 18% just don’t care about their patients... 
this was so precious it was cute when zion yelled happy birthday from where he was too frick … 
starting to feel like vt has just been advertising field trips for 52 students every week and surprising them by putting them into a football stadium. #sendhelp #buildingyear 
just a warning: this is an actual ad released by @ ppact and it is probably the most solidly evil thing i have ever seen. brace yourselves. #plannedparenthood #prolife #conservative 
@ rachellugo5 you did nothing wrong your so called friend should have called i hate the way hannah speaks about you she is not nice women #youlookfab 
@ emmanuelmacron pretty bad when you have to physically separate adult to ensure they don’t break the rules. such an electro school move we love you usa don't give up on us usa want last long thank you sir 
@ raiders this is just and #pathic, we have never been this #inept...ever... 
@ seahawks making #baddecisions again in the 4th quarter... #uggghhhh #disappointed 
what else do they have have but lie, fear and deceit! they are damn good at it too! 
i'm just saying history has been kind to liberals which you stated the opposite and me fighting you now is me doing something. so, please please try to be smarter it's really how small minded you are. and you don't know my identity or what i have done. look at the #snowflake 
...and this is only one tweet. a representative one for sure, but not the only one like this. 
i’m just a “day dreamer and a night thinker” #quote 
how stupid are the magas that they believe the crap that trump just makes up?! there is no truth to this. it's just mind-boggling how he can lie and the maga sheep eat it up. #covfefe 
are you guys still counting? 
all these persons online and yet still im bored 
@ outrumpsumer … 
@ realdonaldtrump beyond your words of uncleaned forest blamed for cal. fires, try to understand, there has been drought and lack of rain this summer. even under the ground, the roots are dry. using political rehtoric to avoid helping victims, is unconscionable and immoral! 
[ makes me so sad to see that students now need to learn how to stop bleeding in the event of a shooting at their school. when will it be enough? when will the violence end?] #stoptheviolence #stopthehate #loveinstead 
i’m hoping for a prayer @ staceyabrams ! the only way kemp can win is suppressing voters. #sad!!! go stacey! 
that's not very christian-like of you steve 
we’re still trying to tip toe through the messiness that is america. 
so the trump regime won't be able to cage em all.. 
to hear about the passing of comic-legend stan lee, whose #stories have entertained so many of us. a life well-lived. #comics … 
surely satire is in season 
you really think this. wow, #sad.

that would be being bullied, would you say? for his opinion, would you say? bully him into what? going against his beliefs? your way or the highway, yeh i know, that’s safe-school extremism #believethem he is their scapegoat for her mental health issues! #whateverthatshowis 
thank you!!!! yall aint tryna hear plus-size women talk that freaky shxt. it took @ missjillscott givin work to the mic on stage to realize she nasty, lmao. … 
he has only one friend in this world right now and even he has 00000 respect for him... 
this is not good news. rino kevin mccarthy is bought & paid for by gope & k street. lying california kevin’s recent pro-build the wall support will evaporate tomorrow, now that he’s elected. @ jim_jordan is a true patriot who supports @ realdonaldtrump 
he won’t be running for president in 2022 i guess. 
cnn must be so lol 
@ snapchatsupport the paintbrush tool has disappeared since the last updated on 12th nov? is this an error as i love the paintbrush tool and use it quite a lot, please give me positive news! #gutted #pleasefixit 
sadly, the party of #resistance is strongly condemning him without having any facts. 
my service issue is customer service, which you are illustrating by not reading what i said and sending me this message. #horribleservice #poorservice 
#bluewave2018 is real, #caravan is fake news for @ realdonaldtrump & our military ( cost of $200 million real tax payer money ) you all fell for a political play! #trumptrain off the rails.. bye. 
amazingly ridiculous! 
wow, this is my hometown. … 
it was a simple misunderstanding. mira couldn’t understand melania because melania doesn’t speak english well at all. melanie is not an american. hey, melania.....”be best.” #cultoftrump 
most of them r too stupid to understand that. … 
bad life for carmelo anthony’s 
how many bankruptcies does the orange buffoon have under he’s hat ?? we’ll get ready to add another usa … 
ah yes, our moral superiors. 
@ escarry must have one of those grunt work positions with lots of time on his tiny hands to be able to respond to so many comments of his clothes/money-shaming tweet. #bebest. @ flotus please stop this online bully! @ … 
a couple days back i was so close to getting a koya sleeping mask but my sister scammed me and now each night i can’t sleep with koya on my eyeballz 
swallowing tears and smiling even if my chin quivers seems to be the mood of the night. *awesome* 
but not in visiting troops in war zones or going to arlington cemetery on veterans day or visiting ww i memorial in france while other leaders managed to get there in spite of rain or being a draft dodger because of bone spurs. 
@ realdonaldtrump, you are a disgrace to this nation. … 
twitter is like one big spoiler for all the #christmasads. fyi i have a tradition of sitting in bed, on the morning of dec 1st, with a packet of tissues, silently weeping at the cuteness overload and persistent tugging on my frozen over heartstrings. #spoileralert #therapy 
went to my doctor this week and told her i didn’t want kids; she told me to wait, i’ll regret it;; she had a patient who was 45; i told her i’ll go 2-5 years; but.. why would i want a 10y.o. at age 55 ?? #umm #no #annoyed 
trump’s nightmares will soon come true. … 
everything hits you at night, why? because when you're laying your head down on your pillow trying to fall asleep thats when you start feeling alone in this world so everything thats built up comes crashing down in every part of your body. #alone #heartbroken 
just got my order before the new stickers! 
mayweather fans love this shit 
the #johnstonpress go into administration & all of a sudden some scots huddle around twitter like the manson family saying what a beautiful day it is. #peoplesjobs 
so, its said, @ vp mike pence is more loyal to his god than #trump, repeal him and replace. @ foxnews @ seanhannity @ foxandfriends @ tomilahren @ potus @ realdonaldtrump #republicans @ presssec @ cnn @ cnnbrk @ gop @ senategop @ housegop @ donaldjtrumpjr @ erictrump 
winter depression - new discoveries in treatment of sad #mentalhealth 
#prayforcalifornia @ cnn reports that due to the wildfires, california now has the worst polluted cities in the wolrd!!!!!!!!!!!!! #californiafires 
aahhh, poor baby. can’t handle the job @ realdonaldtrump? i think that’s called a, #derelictionofduty. i would bet $1 million that @ hillaryclinton would’ve handled the trip from abroad, a bunch of phone calls, go to arlington, and a series of other things without issue. … 
i think we all know that the saudi royal family have had very close ties with the white house going back to the george h w bush presidency. and we have become very reliant on their money and oil. not a big surprise, it’s & #unforgivable but its a #capitalistdemocracy$ is … 
maybe the administration and staff will wake up now and do something about our men’s sports programs, especially football! i’ve heard we did not sell our allotment of tickets for the clemson game next week. we actually returned tickets to them. 
poor ole vt isn’t bowl eligible right now and will have to schedule an emergency game with marshal #gotigs 
if you’re a wedding dj try a little harder than a 9 song playlist on loop. #illbeyourcryingshoulder 
queen elizabeth, true to form, offers kind words and condolences to the victims of the devastating california wildfires. president orangina suggested raking the floors. #fail 
you’re grandma is an amazing woman. sad story: i would get them at lunch almost everyday in elementary school, cause they are the best. the thing is tho, the lunch lady would make us wait to eat them last so it would melt right in front of me. 
right now, i feel the full roundness of pure sadness. i know it won’t last forever — but i am engulfed #depression 
sad to say it but if kliff has another game like that against baylor his job might be on the chopping block. #wreckem 
hack @ briankempga "cheated and undermined democracy". … 
the huck is projecting what she thinks about herself on others. just like her boss. #fail is this the best we can do for a public employee? she supposedly works for the usa. but, it’s clear she suffers from sycophant-is. 
@ vp has adopted @ realdonaldtrump's #bullshitartist #liar tactics. 
a sad observation is the impact of this leak to the press compared to the upcoming leak of the president of the united states will make to the saudis. you know he's going to tell them exactly what we know and how we collected it. say goodbye to those sources. 
these are indeed hard times upon us. when reality and clarity are so close.. when right and wrong are so very far apart.. who can be mistaken. it’s an intentional decision to be in the wrong these days. #america #saveus 
opened that balcony door to let the 40 degrees weather inside while im wrapped up in a blanket. some hot cocoa would be nice and a lit fireplace sounds cozy too. i hate these depressing winter feelings. 
wow. very informative article. 
@ foxnewssunday your interview with trump was very disappointing. you allow him to pontificate about fake news and the media being the enemy of the people but didn't call him out once regarding the thousands of lies/mistruths he has uttered over the last two years. 
i think i will forward this tweet to @ flotus as an example of how someone does his best to not “be best” - in fact @ realdonaldtrump you are the antithesis of what we want our kids to become … 
because i can afford going to the @ 5sos concert in madrid haha life's great 
me either #eagles #is60minutesonyet 
@ verizonfios why did your system report no issues when the entire dc metro region experienced problems? 
assuming the seasons not going anywhere the #bengals have made the playoffs in only 14 of 51 seasons. thats 27%. of those 14, they’ve won a playoff game 3 times, so just once besides the 2 super bowl runs. so less than 6% of their seasons result in a playoff win. #firemarvin 
and truex fails to put him in the wall like he promised. 
what about the #child? … 
your joking right??? the only thing he will balance is the influx of refugees to the citizens. why a refugee gets more money and services than my mother, who spent 40 yrs paying taxes. @ justintrudeau @ andrewscheer i hope you do better when you do when you win #scheer2019
