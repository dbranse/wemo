while you're looking, wouldja keep an eye out for my akubra which blew off and sank without trace during a kayaking trip in the coral sea off a cape trib beach in 2015...? ta. #expensive #sunburned

‘if this was the house of commons’ shut the f up!!! it’s is #cbb and your playing a game!! it’s called having a bit of fun!! #cbbann 
plans never go as planned. so fucking 
another problem that happened while we were away - the fridge is on the blink! another thing for the to do list. the house is obviously rebelling against us being away! #expensive #busyweekahead 
@ facebook fix your mobile site. i try to leave a comment on a page and all of a sudden this happens. and it's not my phone or the accounts because on multiple attempts i will finally be allowed to comment. this happens on different pages randomly. 
never fails, when in a women's store waiting on my girl, i will find the most remote location to stand to be out of the way...multiple women will have me repeatedly move so they can look at something behind me they have no intention of buying #why #women 
pet peeve: people riding bikes on the trail and blasting their music. guess what? i don’t want to hear your music, i want to hear mine . get some earbuds. #petpeeve #rude #wtf 
@ skyuk totally unimpressed with the new sky q since we upgraded in december. huge problems - just want to watch #silentwitness @ emiliafox #saturdayrelax 
just my mum that always feels the need to be on the house phone constantly? 
i have no idea why @ chilis would ruin the great #marketing value of their previous jingle by replacing it with an #repetitive version that makes me change the channel asap. haven't been to chili's since the new jingle. 
@ dominos_uk keighley branch never brought our ice cream tonight that we had paid for.

ok ppl those videos on social media where someone “pranks” someone else by creating a huge embarrassing scene are not pranks ... so stop filming yourself awkwardly falling in front of a bunch of people #pranksaresupposedtobefunny 
what is wrong with the @ nytimes and @ nytpolitics lately? #wrong … 
the library is pin-drop quiet - your whispering does not make it less annoying that you're on the phone in the library. go outside. 
way to put troy aikman (he's not biased or anything) in the booth to call one of biggest eagles game in years @ foxsports #baddecision 
lmfao anytime i say i want something like chinese food or denny’s, troys mom gets her husband to take her to eat there and makes it known to us that she’s there

i will never drink @ budlight again. #dillydilly 
romo is the absolute worst announcer. ever. #nfl 
my biggest pet peeve is when people tell you a story has a big twist! especially if they say they aren’t giving spoilers. the whole point of a twist is you don’t see it coming! #nospoilers #ruinedit 
tony romo must be brady's biggest fan!

@ amazon might save some money if @ usps were better at delivering packages. i swear they “lose” one of my packages a month. i’m betting its cause my mailman constantly delivers mail to the wrong address

various peeps on the streets of lisbon seem to like sidling up to me every five minutes to offer illicit substances i do not require. is this normal? i just told one of them to f off and he went: “oooooh” in the most camp way possible. this also strikes me as… unusual

i mean seriously i don’t give a flying fuck if you’re the pitcher or mike trout. if the lead off man hits a double, the next man up is bunting wether they like it or not! i’d rather have a man on 3rd with 1 outs and two tries to score him in. #smallball #dodgers 
either that or little miss moans a lot about being loyal 
@ loveisland keep saying you are loyal doesn't make you loyal #loveisland #loveislandaftersun #shutthefuckup

@ travelodgeuk this is the 3rd time in a row i’ve booked a hotel with you and then in less than 24hrs you send me an offer for them dates, which i can’t use now as i’ve already booked and payed!

being a step mom is hard. you don't fight the kids. you fight their "real" parent. even when you lay down ground rules with and for each other, the "real" parent always seems to find a way to do what they want, not caring about consequence for the step parent #justme

that noise your straw makes when you're trying to get around the ice. #loudscreech 
i’m sick of being my sons tent. #fatherandson 
@ starbucks someone needs to teach your baristas how to make the salted caramel cold foam cold brew. i spend 50 dollars a week on this damn drink and i have to go through a whole debacle just to get it right. and sometimes it doesn’t come. #wtf

@ netflixuk able to categorise content as 15 or 18 & evidently recognise that some content is suitable for 18 year olds but not 15 year olds. so, why is there no option to allow 15-rated content but not 18-rated content? causing too many arguments in the house. 
our offense has gone to time killing mode. #chiefskingdom

@ npcpresident andrea, you were particularly prickly & rude today with #cenkuygur. you interrupted, interjected, talked over him, or even chided and pointed at him almost continuously, and abused your status as moderator to dominate and insert you petty grievance views. 
i’ve been getting so many spam phone calls lately.

i don’t understand unfollows of any sort unless the person is a completely terrible human. i said i was getting off earlier cause i’m not feeling well. someone unfollowed for being sick #whatever could just be a coincidence of the timing but still. 
do some people just irritate you so much sometimes that you would just love to punch then right in the nose? then you realize it won't do any good because they are thick between the ears. 
channels called richie k actually. idk why it removes the k. #weird

@ victorylap what genius put your set where fans can be idiots when you are on air? @ ismraceway 
when you try, constantly, to do nice things for a person and they just keep blowing you off and being ungrateful. or dont even notice your efforts. i really just need to be done being the nice person for a little bit. #sickofthisshit 
honest, you need to stop. you represent the dregs of society and harass good, fair, working people. the real people in society don't enjoy seeing or hearing from you. you really are an annoyance. you know this is a staged attempt to defame tucker's character. 
when will people learn! it’ll take just as long to drive and be seated at another restaurant then to just wait to be seated at the restaurant you’re already at!

like i'm not huge into superhero movies, i'll admit that but there's definitely a few i really love and the recent avengers i've really enjoyed. so telling me "you don't even like marvel" when stan lee has passed away is really stupid #ihatepeople
