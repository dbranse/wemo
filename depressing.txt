now i know why my local @ postoffice had such bad service before christmas. seems it's now run privately by @ uoeuk. the experienced & familiar faces of the last 15 years have mostly 'left' –replaced by yellow-uniformed youngsters, one of whom was extremely rude in dec.

nothing for infrastructure? no new road/rail links? you're desperate for liverpool waters, but there is no way to get there. plus 38,000 new shop jobs, while the rest of us have to commute to warrington/manchester for work 
one assumes from this that previous us presidents have never used profanity? increasingly seems looking & sounding 'right' far more important than outcomes.

are you serious? this is how you resolve anyone's problem? … 
going back to 2016..i think that was my first #breakthrough ..i was down and out..i didn't know what was to come but i just wasn't feeling life..it was of sorts..then we moved into this & things rapidly changed. 
... well... if that's the level of authenticity that's working these days... #nofutureforgreatliterature … 
long days or short days, sometimes both can be #depressing. just got to #fight through those days. 
i know. same here. hard being in california seeing another ky shooting near my old stomping ground #sad #kentuckystrong 
#gaysextourism #sextourism you can have sex wherever—but it doesn’t make you worldly… 
that is so heart breaking. and it’s yet another time a school shooting has been covered very little by the media. 
how many points do we need for safety? #bcafc 
this is why i’m a republicrat! our public servants are a bunch of soft, selfish, dishonest “flip flop pimps” on both sides of the isle. #grrrrrrr i’m going home to go watch a stormy daniels film. maybe that will cheer me … 
man i can’t even start to argue that peyton is better than tom anymore. 
listen. in just one week, we had gps transcripts, fire and fury, an affair with a hooker who was silenced with campaign money, shithole comments about entire countries, and a government shutdown. nothing is taking this sob down. #tuesdaythoughts #whydiddemscave 
it’s like most jobs how ignorant? do most people have to spend six months away from loved ones where they could be killed or worse? suffer ptsd after they leave then are not looked after by the very people the fought for 
bloody tight there!! after such a good performance against #mcfc 
too frustrated to read anything about #lfc today #lostcause 
a day in the life of the #pnw #gloom 
#toptable fecking place seems to be regressing instead of moving on 
never listened to the song marry me by thomas rhett until today,, thought it was very cute n sweet for first 45 seconds then it just went entirely downhill 
@ armandosalguero there's a reason why i like you: you speak the truth and you aren't afraid to be brutally honest about all things @ miamidolphins your recent column spoke volumes to the ineptitude of my team. rudderless ship with no captain. #truth 
here's some fun advise. never look to see how much cars you once owned are currently being sold for. 
i was grounded from going to cobb on friday nights after getting caught … 
can everyone just be decent to one another? 
@ cnn & @ msnbc over the last 2 years u changed programming 2b exclusively #politics only #trumptv, except when a mass shooting or plane crash breaks it up. could u do 1hr per week on the world. ur makes me want 2 jump from a building need a change in #americannews 
right now the writers are hold up in a room trying to figure out how to make people more sad 
the school shooting in kentucky should be major news but since ~only~ two kids were killed it barely even registers 
wow @ skysportsnews #dannymills is so #negative and give it a chance #uefanationsleague 
anyone incredulous about daca being so popular yet having problems getting legislation behind it must be forgetting the call for background checks after sandy hook. representatives represent their donors, not their constituents. 
everytime the visit orlando advert comes on, i die a little inside #visitorlando

sorry #yql for the crappy weather coming this weekend. it always happens when i can finally get a weekend off. #mycrappyluck 
$twtr’s weekly chart showing quarterly earnings is so ugly it can make an onion cry. 
back in the day when i ate junk food and still weighed 7 1/2stone everyday....and used a massive leather saddle every time i rode! 
my cousins' situation makes me so,....so, mad... 
because they believe women to be inferior in these groups. men are their ticket to heaven. without the marriage the woman cannot attain "salvation". … 
really shouldn’t watch #aplaceinthesun! 
one of the more experiences is hearing someone describe a cult movie you grew up on as a financial risk or failure. we think: how can something that was so important to us as children be evaluated in such cold blood. is it not important that we loved it? #bladerunner 
this came up on my #facebook news feed today: …. #usmnt #worldcup2018 @ oldtakesexposed 
still nothing from @ barclaysuk - two official complaints in place and absolutely nothing being done about either of them. #zerocustomerservice #cantevenfixtheirownmistakes

yeah but, as soon as it comes in it goes lol 
6 most #clubs to support - #football is full of highs and lows. however, it can also be upsetting, especially if you are a fan of one of these clubs. 
oh dear. so reminds me of picketing the lse athletics annual dinner because they had a stripper. in 1974. of course the #presidentsclub might be these chaps all grown up. #waytogo

we seem to forget it though...30 year cycle if my career is anything to go by … 
i realised today that ive stopped living life. im just trying to get to the next day, just getting by with the thought of tomorrow, im not living, and the trouble is i dont know what is it is exactly im waiting for, im scared of whatot might be. #depressed #sad #life 
as a working single mum and in all seriousness without child benefit and tax credits we would be screwed 
that's why i stopped watching the news. 
@ stephenasmith @ detroitpistons 6 game skid now down by double digits y’all got show more urgency or fight to watch 
i seem to be developing a real intolerance for #timewasting with more news today, life has never felt so short. it hurts me to think of the hours we all waste. more #determined than ever now. 
tbf not even klopp looked arsed, you really wouldn’t believe we were playing in the cup #lfc 
what an absolute shit show. no way the fucking baggies should be able to play with the reds. let alone boss a game at anfield...a fall flat performance from start to finish. #lfc #emiratesfacup #fuckinell 
liverpool have set themselves back years by failing to retain coutinho.

i want to be in that dressing room for that jurgen klopp half time talk #livwba @ lfc 
not to be too #depressing, but i'm drinking a yoohoo & thinking about a late relative who always called me "yoohoo" and feeling sort of bad for not going to his funeral..... 
conor sweeney giving a masterclass in tactical fouling at no.11 for tipp. hasn’t even dawned on cork forwards to do the same despite tipp spraying the ball around. #awful #corkvtipp 
someone has put pet shop boys album on in pub 
everyone in #education knows that #leaguetables are all about cohort. teachers do their best for students; life gets in the way more for some than others. govt naming & shaming only drives teachers away from areas of most need. … 
summary of news on the radio currently: people died in accident, people died somewhere over seas, someone was murdered, football bollocks, shit whether. this is why i generally avoid the news these days. 
@ metv as much as we love watching #metv, its getting harder to do so all ur commercials are depressing. where is a toy comm or something diff. they r all about abused homeless animals. the aspca runs abt ever other comm brk. the same kids w cancer. #changeitup 
my wife wants to know why i can't watch something uplifting. i specialize in #documentaries.

@ discostewl @ adscameron i honestly believe only the threat of dropping into league one will make him sell. and then only after he's stripped the club of all saleable assets. #nufc #ashleyout 
you've lived here your whole life and still don't know how commas work? also, if you are a christian how can you support a man who openly cheats on his wife? 
klopp doesn't care about the captain's armband. he said himself he picks a team then realises he has to make someone captain before they go out... 
haven't been getting home from work til 9-9:30 lately, but of course when i plan ahead for my 5 night stretch and take bentley to my parent's house i'm home by 7:40.

everyone but @ nufc are signing players around us. we are falling behind everyone and it’s so depressing! #championshipherewecome 
thanks, #nytimes! the fact that thousands of accounts are #fakefollowers actually makes this whole twit-thing a little less #depressing. p.s. no offense to my #real peeps ;) 
i wouid prefer the snow to the close to 300mm of rain we have had in 29 days so far this year, that is 1/4 of our yearly total, #s.a.d.

@ lbc @ mrjamesob as you said, this is a national shame! people being homeless/in poverty whilst in employment of any kind should be a complete scandal. we're one of the richest countries on the face of the planet and still have so many homeless people! 
i have established that the uk is just one big dementor... it just sucks all the happiness and joy out of people! 9:45 and its like the sun hasn't even come out yet! 
maybe until it gets back in the green you should only update once a day? 
looking at how much has changed, and i know i can never go back there. but i wish i could, just for a moment. more so, i wish i had made better use of my time, had pulled my friends closer, had been a better friend myself. kinda #nostalgia #regrets 
yep. i'm with you. i called mal's office and left a message expressing my absolute disgust. hoping this can be quashed before it becomes a reality. #disgusting 
it’s time to get #real and here friends. i need to be loved to live and if i don’t have that than everything sucks.

#depressing, what a football club @ arsenal 
wait, both houses of congress can overwhelmingly vote for something like sanctions on russia and then the president can just say no? i really should've paid more attention in ap poli-sci. #igota4ontheaptest

today i interviewed a #cairo tuktuk driver who believes the answer to his city's harassment problem is for women to cover up from head to toe and not go out after 7pm. "if a woman wears makeup and dresses provocatively, men like me can't help ourselves."

having spent the best part of two week's annual leave doing diy, i am swiftly coming to the conclusion; i'm crap at stuff. fixing my guitar; made a horse's arse of that too. starting to question my self-proclaimed abilities in other critical areas of my marriage!

last night, i watched 22 honest players. i am looking at manchester city spending millions on players who probably are no more than bench warmers. i feel sick at what’s going on at the top level. that’s why i love @ hendonfc @ mccann2507 and tolerate @ hfc_guv

so are you going to do anything meaningful to rectify this situation, mr. wilf, or are we just supposed to write this off as how the universe hates the vikings, but hates even more the vikings' fans? #celebratingoverhalfacenturyoflosing #whyamistillavikingsfananyway

no way #depressing. everyone goes to football to see #goals and that's what you get at a boro game right??? 
no rooney, no sigurdsson, no tosun, no baines... big sam, no brains... watching #everton now! seriously, what sort of proper manager puts a new defender straight into the team against good opposition??? #arsveve 
jansson and co used to drive the midfield and it was a total shambles #lufc #mot i miss the days of batty, viduka, smith, rio in their prime. where’s the leaders? 
#lufc #leedsunited reality is season is over - no chance of top 6 as we are just not good enough - i would at least start using all these under 23s we have … 
pathetic results from both scotland and rangers. 
have... to... stop... looking... at... pcs... 
no words for that. apart from #depressing. so much optimism and it's all gone #walvsco 
f'king joke!! we'll still be in this division in 20 years time. following this club is pure disappointment!

unbelievable this was one year ago. today, there is no green grass or leaves on trees and the tulips aren’t even thinking about blooming. #wheresspringweather #sendhelp

let's think about this before we start calling for may to resign, who is going to take her place? if you think #windrushdeportation and #brexit are bad, just you wait to see what comes next if may is replaced. tragically, she is the lesser of all evils, for now. 
another day on l. i. it’s not the rain but the cold that won’t let go. i miss spring so. april showers ought to clear air &sky of #winter’s trance. this cold causes the body to ache& the heart to be indifferent. it is like our body politic, it’s a trumpian dystopia. 
where you hear on @ bbc5live about dreadful traffic on m25 knowing full well you have to go that way

fucking proper sick of working weekends roll on sunday night! #asyouwere 
why are @ bandq staff so happy on tv adverts & yet so miserable in store? local b&q are rude on the phone & when you go in to store it’s like entering the land of misery. they all seem to be counting down to leaving time & look like they’ve been told they’ll die. 
i'm sad to see the sims franchise go, i can't believe @ ea thinks mobile will ever replace the sims games. #ripsims 
#endlessart by a house a list of famous dead artist/musicians/writers, he doesn’t mention one woman? am i wrong @ bbc6music? they couldn’t find any females to add to their list of great and good! #poor 
this is #depressing, i've spent 382 minutes getting from a to b with @ uber this year! #ridereport almost 7 hours in uber. 
don lemon is on cnn and just mentioned golden showers, and these are the kinds of political discussions we have to have now, because it's 2018.

this is the first saturday in like 2 months that i dont have plans. 
so, peel the #earth, & it will shrivel, turn brown, & die...and us along w/it.

yes, i’m an american excited about #royalbaby because us news is 
notwithstanding efforts to create live/work/play communities, we're still spending a lot of time #commuting … 
really! all the news these days is so biased. … 
it's not an odd number. it's a significant % of racists we have in the uk. get out of the cities, go to the country villages away from commuter belts and you will find it aplenty. 
sadly we live in a country with a large percentage of people with similar views. go to any pub, particular the more old fashioned drinkers pubs and you will hear it time and time again. media people do not circulate in those circles and so are unaware of the extent. #depressing. 
no problem. happy to be of service. wish i had a warning. #heartless #dark #herodies @ brbird @ wcth_tv @ erinkrakow @ dlissing @ loriloughlin @ hallmarkchannel

why do all my shows kill off my favorite characters #whencallstheheart 
that was garbage tonight, its shite being a sky blues fan, we will probably limp into the play offs only to get dumped out in the semis. then we’ll have yet another summer of wholesale changes before the div 4 tedium starts again in aug #pusb #coventrycity #league2

grimm day... #weather #cold #cloudy @etten-leur, noord-brabant, netherlands

... and there you have it: a *scottish* labour mp more concerned with scoring party points than defending scotland's interests. 
i think i need to skip skimming and scanning the #news coz it is too #depressing! in the us, the endless shootings. in india, the usual suspects are the spiritual rapists. i am halfway sick already! need a breather! 
if you stand back and take a long cold look at what tories do it's impossible to avoid drawing comparisons to things which happened in the 2nd quarter of the 20th century in another country policies designed to kill off the poor, sick disabled & racist policies etc 
when its white supremacy light skinned niggas suffer cah they black .. in black supremacy they suffer cah they light

kid #1 keeps asking to come to my new job, and today’s #takeyourkidtoworkday would have been perfect, but alas, she has a court ordered visit at the foster agency. her 563rd afternoon at the foster agency for visits to be exact. 
pulitzer schumlitzer. rap music today is depressing. i’ve been listening to it since 1979 and stopped over the past 20 years because it just can’t live up to the stuff that came out in the late 80’s. this trap beat stuff? 
pretty sure our summers done already! 
what more important job could there be for the local press? @ … 
no wonder the country is in such a state! not a single credible party! 
it's #sad when your a kid eating #icecream for dinner is amazing but when your an #adult it's just .

@ itvcorrie why can't the scriptwriters give simon some good storylines rather than him always being a horrible little shit ! #boring 
fb lately has only been good for finding out what lifelong friends want me locked in a cage or dead for minding my own business while owning property they don't like. 
wahwah... barely any change in tech and comparison journals of women authors over 10 years #arld18 #changenow 
- just simply depressing. 
i love it when you lay in bed at night and think about how the guy you really liked and never really got over in high school now has a long term gf and how you continue to be single and lonely. #thingsthatkeepmeupatnight 
not even off the plane from benidorm an hour and i've got the holiday blues already! 
when you waste your final day to yourself without kids.... shopping for stuff for the kids #mumlife 
depressing scene at lccc today now being mirrored in the county as a number of tomorrow’s games have already fallen foul of the weather #thebritishsummer 
can't cop tonight @ thecarltonshow. painful for so many reasons. we know the mitigants but we continue to invent ways to butcher opportunities. so many basic unacceptable errors. too many slow and low skilled players who aren't up to it. scoreboard flattered us imho 
owen jones on gmb, depressing this guy gets air time on prime tv, where’s @ piersmorgan to ask him the real questions.... he’s like a child who just makes stuff up to to push his ideology #owenjones 
@ watchthebreaks @ fantasybbhero 
glad you had some good weather. cows out 8.15 and back in by 1pm, rained all day and don't want too much poaching on our heavy land so early in the season. 
ya we would be the same here. have very dry land but it's very damp at the moment . i feel for anyone with wet land as 2 good drying days here and we be sorted . this wet spell is starting its 8 month 
#househunters san francisco, my favorite city ever. their budget is 1 million. hate them so much! i’ll realistically probably never own a home in sf. prices are outrageous.

turning down jobs because of schedule i got with the court

khan & co speak for a minority of idiots who are fully paid up members of the “cutoffnosetospiteface club 
politicians, treasury and lack of a proper industrial strategy 
looks like the heatwave has well & truly gone. for 5 days continuously 
#affordablehousing in london? ha! @ sadiqkhan when? how are first time buyers (teachers in their 30s) supposed to get on the ladder with prices like these? and what makes it worse, is for the same price in belfast, you could buy a mansion with a heap of land attached! 
watched “when a monster calls” - damn that movie needs trigger warnings 
that inning was so #royals... bases loaded, nobody out, score zero. 
we are light years behind city and therefore we will not be champions anytime soon. too slow, too ‘inaccurate’ when we have the ball, no imagination, little creativity. we rely on size and power and we have become a ‘cup team’. 
how is the weekend over already?! 
the vacation is almost over and we’ll s heading back into town soon. #sundaymorning 
adulting: going to bed at 10 pm 
i was feeling like i needed a pick me up, so decided to watch the #movie downsizing. it is disguised as a comedy in the trailers but i assure you it is not. it starts off like it's a comedy but then heads down a very dark bleak path.

leaving aside the #brexitshambles - if you take the fact that teresa may is the architect of #windrush and #gohomevans etc., the uk really just has another version of the trump administration with better grammar.

there are a bunch of overweight kids, at least some of whom don't live in the apartment complex, screaming in the parking lot. i'm single and have no children but never get a day off from ones whose parents are proof there's no god. #child #protective #services

well the ‘fight back’ won’t be in our lifetime david. we’re blindly walking into the abyss of political correctness. by the time the country wakes up, it will be like trying to unravel our eu membership, impossible & blocked by the elite who swear they know better.

well, @ thinkdefence is onto a winner with but it doesn’t half make reading 
i hope someone does a fact check on this, but have a queasy feeling that many news organizations will repeat this falsehood without correcting it, diminishing their own credibility further, thus creating a larger market for alternative news sources. …

how haven’t @ chesterfc made this list?!

exactly. labour is between a rock and a hard place. go too far one way and you lose votes and vice versa. stay in middle and do nothing & you get bang average results like today. #difficult 
same old arsenal - dominant in possession, couldn't do anything with it, shambolic defending 
suppose it was eminently predictable. where else was the fucking ukip vote going? 
nhs & schools crumbling, crime rising, incomes flat, massive debt, tory councils bankrupt, weak pm, spate of ministerial resignations, woeful brexit negotiations, and yet corbyn’s . @ uklabour can’t win local elections. momentum my ass... … 
for the majority of my voting life the #tories under major hague & cameron tried to reverse the age old image of the party and its divisive polices by controlling the extremists. the #ukip vote back to them in the #localelection2018 takes us back to the dark days 
it tells us that no matter what the tories do, people will still vote for them. windrush, grenfell, nhs, child poverty, homelessness, housing crisis, austerity, food banks, dup, tuition fees, police & fire service cuts. the list goes on and on... 
of course, the day i go to the akin crawfish festival, @ themasonramsey isn’t there. story of my life. :( 
its very frustrating for me as a human to get amazing reactions year after year from fans but cant seem to make a living doing so.

oh no! i finally finished gta5. it ate my life for over a year. i thought i'd be ecstatic. i can move on but.. instead i have a sad. 
it makes me mad actually. too many people are going to learn the hard way, after the fact, and have no voice and there's nothing we will be able to do about it. 
it must be so depressing and scary to live/work with you. to think you can kill people and not be indicted. to think you can pardon yourself. as a nation, we're ashamed. i can only imagine how those close to you think and feel. #nomanisabovethelaw #pardon

as disgusted as i am by #potus, i have been nothing short of horrified by his devoted followers. the absence of empathy and simple humanity is shocking. the rage, division and unfiltered hatred being spewed by people is beyond me. this may never be repaired.
