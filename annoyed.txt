@ jcpenney you make it really tough to be a customer. i regularly have issues returning stuff, your 1-800 cs associates are unhelpful and your warehouse picks the wrong items. i've wasted entirely too much of my time on this 1 order. #aggravated

if you eat eggs and butter you are not a vegan! don’t order a dish withholding the meat and say it’s “vegan based”, you’re not impressing anyone and confusing the kitchen staff.

when you’ve missed placed something and are attempting to retrace your steps, total recall would be super helpful right now.

hey, @ bnbuzz employee, please don't argue with me with your dismissive tone about my teacher discount and how it's not a better deal than your membership discount. my books were cheaper with the teacher discount, so shhhhh. @ bn_care

@ loft i ordered a few things online yesterday and i’ve gotten two emails about products being out of stock. why inform customers of this after they’ve already been charged? 
wanted to do a simple live stream on my phone. neither #bitstream nor #twitch are cooperating. keep getting errors. i'm sol with everything lately. i restarted my phone, forced stop the apps & nothing seems to work. i really am stuck with vods. 
like packing up your offices and getting ready for the long ride home, unemployed.

is signing emails with "tia" a thing now? i've gotten 3 sign offs like that in the past two weeks. (for those of you scratching your heads, that's short for thanks in advance). is it really too hard to type that out?

@ virginatlantic you need to make your online booking system for flying club members using hard earned miles work so you can actually book seats. feeling decidedly 
i wish people would not misuse the word "fetish" just because you like your sheets ironed & folded neatly does not mean you have a sheet fetish! it just means you are anal af! yeah someone just me! #themoreyouknow #dictionary

dear new neighbor, parking a truck in front of our driveway + then leaving for an hour probably isn't the best first impression. oh, and slamming the door to said truck repeatedly while i'm trying to keep my baby asleep isn't too great either. sincerely,

@ atlassianstride i really don't get the strategy of making your existing customers wait months for "early access," but new customers can sign up anytime. product was released four months ago. still can't use it. slack has never screwed with people like this. #frustrated 
dear #wholefoods: cashiers shouldnt be curt just because you don't want to donate an apple when you're checking out. 
why doesn't any of ny family answer when ai try to call or text them? 
what a shitty unproductive day. 
my family comes over and a topic if conversation they have is my weight. every. single. time. 
@ dixieonline i heard you mention this on the radio this morning ....i even talked about it at work!! … 
karma.... passes down generations too ... my rant for the day 
unfollowing everyone on insta who does live videos on the daily till someone tells me how to hide the notifications. 
i really don’t understand why people have the need to put their phone on speakerphone while in public. like nobody wants to hear your fucking conversation 
my nose is completely stopped up. why is anything dripping out of it??

what’s the point of an order tracker if it’s so inaccurate? @ pizzahut 30 mins over my estimated delivery time #stillhungry 
think billion dollar corporations give a hoot about people? you’d be wrong, they don’t care. walmart has money & ability to pay employees accordingly but instead close sams club with 0 notices to employees or club members. #samsclubsucks #walmartdoesntcare … 
i have a low tolarance for some people lately 
disappointed with @ dollarshaveclub this month. got this huge envelope with a cardboard tray inside with my tiny pack of new blades and inside it basically just told me to get the shave butter. what a waste of so many resources!

@ canadaposthelps please explain to me why on my tracking is says delivered and then all of sudden you are returning my item to the sender because my office was "closed" at 11:07am and was undeliverable after the "second" attempt? when was the first attempt? 
what’s the point of having an appointment if they don’t even call you in at that time? 
just because a political figure is part of your political party, doesn’t make every single thing they do right. it also doesn’t make everyone on the opposing side wrong about everything. 
anytime i see people they ask “how’s studying going” like its not going great i never feel like studying. leave me the fuck alone ill get through it!!! 
@ superdrughelp i bought my mum a large box of ferrero rocher for xmas. she went to eat them the other day & it was due up the beginning of jan. not a great shelf life for a xmas present like that.

i propose a new definition for mansplain - verb - the act of man explaining something to a feminist who refuses to recognise they have missed the fucking point and tries to save face by saying the man is being patronising and sexist. 
@ starbucks should've just asked for a grande instead of a venti #halfempty #greatneck 
when the biggest movie quote is far from correct. the book reads... “ i will be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending i’m not there,” said harry tonelessly #nerd 
i swear all i see on twitter and instagram are these “body goals” and it’s always women. no wonder why every guy has this false expectation on what a woman’s body shape should be.

my snapchat wasn't updated at all today and now when i just went on there everything has changed. what the hell?! 
the in laws are getting on my last nerve!! #enraged 
it’s like snapchat saw my tweet earlier and said, “oh really? oh, well we’ll just go ahead and update yours without asking then. ” 
that @ bullcbs was not recorded on my directv instead there was a great episode of #ncis....... 
at this point, 2 weeks into treatment for the #bronchitis, shouldn’t i be coughing less?

almost busted my ass running for the bus and it wouldn't even stop for me 
placed an order w/ @ adorama on monday and paid extra on shipping for items to be here today. won't be here till tomorrow. this is why i prefer @ amazon these days. when #amazon says it'll be there on this day, it will. 
this sorority girl in my class has interrupted 2 other people asking questions and mentioned her ex 3x in the span of 90 minutes. needless to say, i am

just watched a video of someone putting lipstick on their lips. you really don't need to apply it 20 fucking times. it does not require that much work. #makeup #simple #justdoit 
@ snapchat what are you doing? 
this snapchat update sucks for people like me who only watch a few people’s stories to begin with, and it also slows down @ snapchat a lottttt. 
also, @ twitter: can you please stop showing me notifications about what my followers are liking, retweeting etc. i can see that from my feed, i don’t need to be told about it. all my real notifications (direct mentions, likes, follows) are getting lost in be mix! #wtf 
need to move to a country with no winter.

@ nascaronfox you shrank my tv screen! this new ticker is awful. when you have it across the top, it’s not blocking anything. hoping it’s different for #daytona500 ! #missingtheaction 
that’s the reason i hopped on to twitter too, to see if everyone was annoyed like me. i found one in about 20 quick tweets that like it. #missingtheaction 
yo, . @ snapchat, i didn't know you guys were competing w/ . @ instagram & . @ facebook to make unnecessary & annoying updates that no one asked for!

even at a religious setting, still people from your own country don’t have respect & just randomly jumps in your conversation uninvited... 
social media is social for a reason. story telling, sharing your brand, content from conferences, curated content around subject matter in your area. it's not for being rude! if your mother wouldn't like it, don't post it. 
also why do all plus size stores assume curvier chicks want floral print on everything???? 
why can’t people just be happy for you rather than trying to destroy your happiness?! 
nvm the sun came out... someone love me me!

why are shops in the uk still charging to use your debit/credit card when the government has made it illegal for them to do that? 50p to have the privilege to use a card to pay for something? i don’t think so! check yourself before you wreck yourself

hey @ sears, stop sending me marketing emails. i've unsubscribed 3 times in 2 weeks. do you think bugging people is going to increase profits? i assure you, it won't. #spam 
unsensible assignments in the field of mass communication study. where is the education system going on, i am not saying for all the assignments and even there are assignments which are very productive but there are also those which are useless. #fedup #workbook 
@ cvspharmacy please tel me why every time i use my coupons and send them to my card they are never taken off and the store all they say is i don’t know. sounds like a scam this is the 3rd time and the manager is a waste #northbabylon

i get really irritated when people talk like they’re an expert on things they really don’t know anything about and you see all the flaws in their comments because you’ve spent the last 20 years doing said thing (saying that makes me feel really old as i’m only 26).

when you go to the gym and they don’t have wifi so you can’t access your workouts so you try and go for a walk and end up slippin’ on the ground because of the snow storm that just happened. this is what i get for trying to be healthy. 
i returned one pair of shorts to @ fashionnova and it was delivered to the warehouse but they said they never got it and won’t give me my credit 
so, when the post office puts their priority express envelopes in priority slots and you send it in them with a pre-paid priority label they upgrade you without asking "just in case". and then they charge your customers the increased shipping instead of you. 
blah #stillatwork #annoyed#letmegohomeson

it feels a little like adding insult to injury to have my flight delayed by 5 hours and then be the victim of a crop dusting as i’m waiting to see if i’m actually getting cancelled or not. thanks person. smells great. #sigh 
wanting to surprise someone with doing something special & getting no acknowledgement from that person as if what you did wasn’t out of the ordinary 
using an #android phone for a music player after a decade of using #ipod's is like switching from a 6th-year theater major to a 1st-year computer science major.

quit posting your whole life on social media. some things are meant to be private. if you want to beat someone up, if you want to go tell someone off then do it. we do not need to know. 
waited for over 10 minutes for my iced coffee at @ starbucks and had to leave because it still wasn’t ready. maybe next time the 3 people just standing around could have helped make some drinks #starbucks #needcaffine

@ copearland @ simplerecycling why do we have this service if they never pick up on my scheduled recycling days? about the 4th time this has happened. 
when it’s raining and the $7 valet parking at the #plazalasamericas @ elcentrodetodo @ pfchangs is staffed by a young guy on his phone, huddling from the rain, ignoring us. no umbrella, no attention. we’ll spend our money elsewhere. 
so for the past month every meet and greet, dinner date and scheduled sex date has canceled on us. ugh... 
it's laurel if you're listening to it with something that has bass, it's yanny if you're not. so basically if you're hearing it on your phone speakers you're probably hearing yanny. go listen to it with any headphones that has bass and you'll hear laurel. 
i hate when people say “your guys’s.” is this a word? the whole world is arguing about yanny vs laurel and “guys’s” is the only thing i’m hearing, over and over again. 
with the amount of time i spend in @ verizon stores because they have screwed something up you’d think i would’ve switched to a different carrier by now #ihavebetterthingstodowithmylife 
@ boohoo currently waiting for my 6pm-10pm delivery still not arrived would actually like to go to bed as have #work #tomorrow #nothappy 
i came into work an hour early to make more money & they’re not letting me clock in yet

did anyone really think that trumps doj wasn't going to find something to blame on comey? 
hey @ littlecaesars, how about you hire people who actually know how to make pizzas the way they’re ordered! like, when i order that i want mushrooms on only half of my extramostbestest pizza; that does not mean no pepperoni and mushrooms on the whole thing!

i'm pretty sure people that just seat themselves at a restaurant with a host stand are also the rudest house guests. #serverlife 
went out & got something to eat & ate at the restaurant. there was no one in the place so i grab a table. someone else comes in & proceeds to sit right behind me. then made weird noises as she ate. like come on lady, out of the whole place you had to sit behind me?! 
when you order @ bostonmarket new “creamy parmesan corn” and there’s absolutely nothing creamy or parmesan about it. if you named it the “full of black pepper and onion corn” which is what it is..i wouldn’t have ordered it

@ ebay @ ebaycanada you know the more i think about it, the more i am irked that your offices not only used my image, but changed it ever so slightly. #plagiarism 
#loveisiand i really don’t like ellie she has done wrong and i completely agree with alex she is playing a massive game! she knew he would be an easy target and she took that opportunity and played him! #dontlikeher #playinggames 
would it be too much to ask for a ruling that says gerrymandering is illegal, immoral, and not allowed! supreme court sends back n.c. gerrymandering case, mostly rejects texas map challenge 
i guess they haven't found an easy enough case for the 5 conservajudges to rule against equal rights yet? 
@ target i ordered this dress online and got this disgustingly dirty product. does no one check this before it gets shipped?! 
why do people have to say “jesus christ” when their for sure not referring to him at all... like do they not realize how horrible that is or do they just not care.

sometimes you think your team is good, then they play elite competition and are totally outclassed. happened to the flyers in the playoffs this year and it’s happening to the phillies right now. 
screw mitch mcconnel and his stolen seat. screw trump and his racist kind. at this point, i'm wondering who in the hell would want to come here anyways,, 
whaa whaa! somebody should ask this douche how jail food tastes? 
@ bell_support your cust care centre & chat rep have been no help. why do i always feel it's my problem and not yours to deal with? crave is not working on the receiver, yet i pay for the service. yesterday "yvonne" said she would fix it & "analou" can't fix it today

good! i just wonder what's going to happen when he ignores this? federal judge orders trump administration to reunite migrant families 
easy fix: let non union scabs benefits go away and their pay stagnate, then maybe they'll want some representation. supreme court deals blow to public-sector unions 
the only documents they need to hand these fuckers is the arrest warrants with their names on them! house to escalate mueller document demand with thursday vote 
i guess statesmanship by twitter isn't really a thing! gop immigration bill goes down in rebuff to trump 
ok everyone, calm the eff down. think about it. he is the "5" in almost every 5 to 4 decision, so even replaced with a conservative, the court remains still slightly tilted to the right .

hey @ flyfrontier just spent 30 minutes on hold for the second time today trying to get into contact with customer relations about a canceled flight from last week. does anyone even work at the phone number??? 
@ grubhub_care once, i considered a fluke. but twice now, they are not paying attention. today and on june 8th, i ordered crazy bread with an extra side of dip from @ littlecaesars and i paid an extra $1.50 for it, and did not get it either time. 
@ bt_uk how stupid is this. for 2 days i was unable to access email or log on to the bt app. so followed links on help, change my password and after a while was sorted. only to find an email from bt saying they had suspended my account. what am i supposed to be psychic 
pissed off. poor game. poor from us making 8 changes. absolute rubbish plotting route to latter stages when we now have the tougher 2nd round game against a good columbia side who could well send us home. we didn't try to lose but we had no desire to win the game. 
disappointed tonight. not even trying. can’t stand a cheat 
traffic is stupid! even shortcuts arent shortcuts anymore 
tired of doing the same shit. every. fucking. day.

18 y.o. called 911 and took an ambulance to the er for a sunburn. 
my favorite part of @ facebook is that it will just randomly decide to fill my feed with every post i read 4 days ago. it's cool, i wasn't interested in what's happening today. wednesday's good. but yet i stay... #butwhytho 
i swear my eyes are going to get stuck behind my head today for rolling them too much

listen, @ spotifycares, i get it. drake's label probably paid you a fortune for this "playlist takeover" thing. but i don't pay for premium so i can see uncloseable banner ads for an artist i'm 99% sure i've never even listened to on your service. when will this be over? 
@ littlecaesars what is the point of the new pizza portal when my food is nneeevveerrr ready when it says it’s suppose to be. #20minuteslater

what’s so different about @ sephora freestanding vs the ones in @ jcpenney that you can’t return w/o receipt? how can i use my beauty insider to buy something but you can’t use it look up the receipt? 
well done @ toolstation for your next day delivery, ordered on thursday and still waiting, perhaps i should've gone to @ screwfix 
would have been helpful if @ worldsoffun sent out weather alerts statuses. we just want to know an estimate of how long this delay is... 
i hate when you order a drink @ starbucks with no ice cause you nurse your drinks and don't like them heavily diluted, only for the batista to fill your venti with half water anyhow. thanks. this $4 water is definitely worth it

@ outlook i would really like it if email addresses that i have marked as not junk would not get shunted into the junk folder ever again unless i say otherwise. thanks! 
served country and now support a treasonous embecile enthusiastically. we used to call ppl like that traitors!

never ordering online from @ dicks again. two weeks waiting for a sports bra. i would have rather bought in person, but they don't carry plus sizes in store. a good fitting sports bra is kind of important when you're working out and bigger #fatkidstatus #tryingtobeskinny

all of a sudden putas wanna act like they latina... pero #whatwasthereason

dear @ applesupport, if you could possibly teach your “geniuses” how to take a phone call off hold without hanging up on the customer, that’d be great. it’s happened to me twice now. 
@ starbucks please educate your baristas on the difference between cold brew and a cold foam cappuccino. this is now the third time i’ve gotten home to find out they gave me cold brew instead of the cappuccino i ordered. #whycantyougetmyordercorrect

@ gwnapp why make me create a password at registration and then proceed to give me a password and then proceed to not let me change that god-awful 30 character password you gave me? 
i hate it when i have so much drive to take pictures but no inspiration or anything to take pictures of. like man i really want to take some really good pictures but there's nothing to take a picture of. 
hey @ papajohns.. if the delivery window says, 3:15-3:20 and my order shows up at 3:45 shouldn’t i receive some compensation for waiting?

fat nixon makes a baseless claim, color me shocked!! without evidence, trump claims vindication from release of carter page documents … 
dumpy is such an ass clown. he either, was giving his papa the keys to the kingdom, or his ego is so big, he thinks he can handle anybody in a room. either way, he's wrong and we're all gonna have to dig out from under this enormous pile of shit! … 
because i need another reason to hate the republican party! as trump struggles with helsinki’s fallout, congress faces a new charge: complicity …

every year when nyc restaurant week comes around i say “oh well, maybe next year i’ll have a bf to restaurant hop with” literally been saying this for 4 years 
i hate the fact that when i’m mad at someone i love and they just look at me my ass smiles. like mofo i’m trying to be mad and you had to remind me that i love you just by looking at me. 
the new @ gmail interface changed the functionality of the search box. i now get unrelated emails in my search results. i never liked i couldn't sort by recipient anyway. time to pull out @ mozthunderbird or @ outlook. 
okay, i like baseball, but i’m not an active @ mlb fan. however, i just dreamt i had tickets to game 4 of the world series with @ astros vs @ braves, and i’m pissed my alarm woke me up before i could see who won ‘cause i had incredible seats to a good game! 
also why do companies feel the need to call you be on the phone for an hour and then say i’ll email this info over to you when we hang up?! like email it first let me go over it and then i’ll call you if i want to use you?!? 
okay, but @me next time. … 
i have got to remember that getting into arguments on fb with people is a terrible way to spend my time. 
hate it when you make a nail appt and they make you wait 30 mins then act like you should just be grateful they did their job

what's with having to verify that 'i'm not a robot" on everything. do the government know something we don't or is arnie going to turn up at my house and ask for my clothes boots and motorcycle in which 2 i might add i don't own fucking own. #theworldismad

#currentmood 
people saw “presidential” and they are up in arms. they obviously have not watched the news that said the message is actually fema initiated (generally) and not sent by the president. but that would mean they’d actually have to let go of their hate for a minute.

thursday’s trench truth: have you ever been pretty annoyed or irritated by an issue and you’re pretty sure that no one around you is comfortable either, but you all suppress the urge to address it? #thursdaystruth 
here comes tweets about you hating on every trap song that comes out. pero nadie te molesta cuando haces posts de los tucanes or raymix. 
@ upshelp terrible customer service phone system. tried calling & had to press multiple buttons to speak to a human. who turned out to be useless. there has to be a better way. #frustrated

@ thebhf i know you need to raise money but getting people to knock doors at 8.30 at night is not the way to do it. settting the dog off, that then wakes both kids up. 
when a guy who works at trader joe’s, finds me on facebook, then finds me on instagram and keeps messaging i haven’t responded. what part of me not responding makes you think to keep reaching out!!? i need to go to trader joe’s but i’m scared of running into him

people are particularly annoying today. #ugh 
all i have to say is: idiot. this "corner store caroline" needs a grip on reality and move on. the kid did nothing 2 her. nothing. and calls the cops on him, why? oh, he's black. well, that's "totally justifiable". bs. just bs. … 
@ tacobell i figured i’d chance it and try the triple crunchwrap again and here’s the sad excuse i got i don’t even think there was one serving of beef in it.

@ lirr this is becoming the norm trains running late or missing connections at jamaica. the more we pay the worst the service becomes. the only thing your service confirms is that you’re consistently inconsistent. #takeaccountability

sitting in the doctor's office and of course there is someone who won't shut up 
just finished working out and now i have to wait for the bathroom again..... gawd i love sitting in my sweat #fitnessjourney … 
idk why a patient would lecture me on traffic and how i better be on time if they're going to be late 
the #seven #expressions of #pekoe being … 
so between the frequent rainfall,the long term roadwork and the occasional flooding i am second guessing this move back home. seems trivial in the grand scheme of things but sitting in traffic for twice or more the regular commute time is ridiculous and counterproductive 
solidarity between @ fairyhippie and i is knowing both of us have to say ‘actually i don’t work here’ to customers. 
have you ever just wanted to punch someone so hard they evaporated from existence? no... just me? 
all i wanted was floor seats, none of which were available until now because of resale. but i’ll party anyway. 
having to talk about myself in third person as a homework assignment shouldn’t even be a thing... 
hey @ suntrust, your app never works.

$ vktx wtf? to say the least. #biotech #psychosis 
damn #destiny2 needs an update too. fuck, from now on, day before a planned “veg out to keep my sanity day,” i’m just gonna load up the #xboxone to make sure any & all updates are completed. so i don’t lose gameplay time waiting for updates. 
apparently getting @ microsoft office to work on your computer takes a lot of effort. 
nobody has any sense of work ethic anymore 
@ linkedinhelp is there a way to view your news feed in chronological order when using the app on a mobile device? i keep seeing posts from 2-3 weeks ago as opposed to more recent posts. #frustrated 
@ scotiabankjm explain.saw an amount deducted from my account claiming rtgs deposit in error, yet i cannot see where a deposit was made in the amount. customer service rep tells me i wouldn't be able to see the deposit however i see the deduction.

dear @ ticketmasterca allowing people to buy every ticket for the @ backstreetboys upcoming concert in july and reselling them for nearly triple what they're worth is complete bs! i'm not going to pay $400 to sit in the 300 level #notfair 
i love how @ delta will charge me to check my luggage but won’t reimburse me when they break it #airlinessuck 
i’m so emotional i probably am pregnant... but it ain’t on no crying shit i’m getting pissed w/ the quickness 
by the end of this war, you'd think everybody would be free. right? #endslavery 
i tried to take a test proctored today, but they ended up not being able to give it to me cause i never filled out a proctor form. #frustrated #hatemyliferightnow 
stop repeating yourself and stop bragging 
some days the excuses really get on my nerves. i know i used to be one of those people. but i’m not now, so #annoyed. 
ugh twitter has me fooled. i’ll be sitting in class on my phone with the volume off, and then i click on a moment or a video and bam volume is all the way up and the whole class hears some gay shit. 
hey friends in omaha, the flu is going around...and of course, it is a string that isn't covered by the flu shot. so, good luck. take it from me...it sucks. 
i fucking hate everyone... it’s all a bunch of he say she say bullshit and it really getting really annoying. and they wonder why i stay to myself, like damn are we in hs anymore 
this has been me all day today 
why does it have to storm on a friday .... 
never ever have discussions on the personal line 
how do you kindly tell a family member to shut the f... up. you talk too much. 
@ pizzahut i’m sick and i ordered pizza so i didn’t have to go anywhere. your driver hung up on me and then wouldn’t get out of the car till i came out there to pick up the pizza. she was rude! #ugh #sick 
there are rules to the game and it’s alot of folks out here that need a refresher!!!! 
does pregnancy make you hate people? lmao #allthetime 
anyone else’s parents wait till last minute for everything 
why are people’s messenger updating but mines gone back to the old version #messenger 
waiting to hear from specialists is so frustrating #sorehand #sorearm #frustrated 
went to my doctor this week and told her i didn’t want kids; she told me to wait, i’ll regret it;; she had a patient who was 45; i told her i’ll go 2-5 years; but.. why would i want a 10y.o. at age 55 ?? #umm #no #sad 
you keep asking me the same shit i already answered 2-3times... you hear but you don’t listen. 
being a working mom means missing out on some things. i get that. but if they would of asked i wouldn't have had to miss that. #workingmom 
@ asklyft why dont i have bonus options available. first week in a while i have ability to meet goals you dont have any for me? , #amimissingsomething 
i guess the saying is true that if someone misses you they'll make time. 
@ burstoralcare you guys should really consider using someone other than @ dhlus for your shipping. my package has been en route for over 3 weeks now. 
it is my least favorite thing when people spell my name wrong in emails. like, you had to type my name to get the email address to show up, why did you then spell it wrong in the greeting??? 
i give up! 
so annoyed that maps sent me away from 75 traffic to end up in 2-lane traffic right next to 75, which is moving swiftly. 
total disgrace pete. words fail me on how this can happen and when it’s made public they seem extremely brazen about it. for anyone who has given time free of charge they should see this as a slap in the face. needs sorting ... as we all know 
@ getspectrum @ ask_spectrum i'm a spectrum customer (tv/internet) who already opted out of spectrum mobile's mailed offers....so, why have you resorted to this type of deceptive mailer? #spectrum #spectrummobile 
really disappointed in @ delta whom i usually trust and am a loyal sky miles member. cancelled my flight last night, stuck on the runway in vermont, and very inattentive customer service in vermont 
for as much attention i give my house pipes i should’ve been a plumber 
ooooohh i swear my sister is such a salty bitch i love her though.. but i hate her at the same time 
wow @ alaskaair - nice. cancelling a flight in may, needs to be rebooked on your airline and you have nothing that will get me to my destination on the same day i leave. so now i get to miss a day of my holiday i've paid for the hotel on, or spend 30 hours travelling. 
|| when the person you were rping with completely disappears..... 
i think the real reason people upgrade their icloud storage is so they will quit getting emails. #overit #apple #icloud 
// the moment ppl start to tick you off at a rave. it might be a good idea to go home earlier! 
i absolutely hate when friends assume something that’s untrue. 
while waiting ...... much face. 
it’s 2018 and cell phones exist! there is absolutely no reason why you should wait in your car outside someone’s home honking non stop until they come out! 
it must be use your chain saw and power tools day in my neighborhood. so much for enjoying some sunshine and peace on my back deck. 
annoyed with my recent phone update. #samsungj7. when messaging, it keeps capitalizing words that don't need to be... and it keeps giving me that option even though i try and delete it or check the correct way i'm spelling it #annoyed. 
i don’t get why people have to brag about grades in school? like congrats you get an a? life isnt based on how well you did on a black and white type test 
whyyyyy would you mail my first check when i live 5 minutes away from you? #neeeedmymulah 
why do some people act like they want to hangout with you all the time & make plans with you & when it comes to the time to hangout they always bail like why do you even act like you want to hangout i don’t get it?? 
so apparently i never registered my tivo series 3 (lifetime service) in my name, and can’t do it now because it’s old. if i could hook my netflix acct to my tivo like i did before, this would not matter. but that isn’t working either. 
important q, is there any point in letting a man know when he is "mansplaining"? i think most of the time they have no idea that they are doing it, so would it be constructive to let them know? would making them aware make a difference? #mansplaining #questionoftheday 
when @ waltdisneyworld says a 90 minute wait and 2 1/2 hours later you’re still in line and they keep saying it’s a slight delay. #epicfail #firstworldproblems #thissucks – bei seven dwarfs mine train 
so annoyed with getting @ starbucks and feeling like the baristas are annoyed with you when you ask them to fix your drink because it isn’t right. i spend money every day. sorry that i feel my $6 drink should be perfect. 
can i ever have a nice quiet lunch with out having a fucking loud mouth seating next to us? 
@ firstsouthyorks at it yet again driver sees you at the door but still drives off... awful service yet again fed up of logging complaints with no response from @ firstsouthyorks as always, same old log a complaint and we will get back to you remarks from @ firstsouthyorks 
i still can't believe graeme is in blackpool, than danny. #why #hecantdance 
yes. 
people will question any good they hear and believe the bad without a second thought. we all need to worry about ourselves and own happiness or lack there of, and stop messing with each other’s. 
my fallout backing is starting to slip. i have had nothing but issues with the special system. i am missing a perk point entirely and then i just pick endurance, got the card i picked and a point was put into agility. @ bethesda @ fallout #fallout76 #bethesda 
i just want mercury out of freaking retrograde already. 
seriously wondering when i’m going to meet one of those decent guys people keep talking about. i’m sick of assholes and guys assuming i’m down to just fuck

the game is to close for wentz to stat pad.. wait till we down 10 before he gets going. 
#at #life 
sick of the arbitrary bs that is destiny 2 comp atm. i’ve been playing the best crucible of my life, consistently posting the best stats, for nothing. and no, lfg stacks aren’t viable thus far. still a coin flip of teammate quality there also. been climbing more solo q. 
love #xfactor however tonight's result proves that #themes ruin chances. point is to find genuine talent, people with this can't conform to themes, wonder would adele have sung rock to prove her talent. @ simoncowell losing shan proves ya's got something wrong #rantover 
@ itv your live tv in app isn’t working i’m missing #imaceleb since the break! 
nothing annoys me more than when someone message me only to not reply when i respond. like tf don't bother if that's what you're gonna do 
looks like i’m not watching #imaceleb tonight as itv player keeps saying there is an error with my login even though it was fine just before 9! @ itvhub 
absolutely cba with guys #cba 
@ jamescharles 
how about work on fixing the dlc so we can play it? … 
when you forget your slides on long road trips, and you have to put and take off your shoes every stop... 
who wanna drive in this cold ass weather let alone 17 miles just to pick his ass up 
how can people live under someone else’s roof and not get annoyed. 
when someone has work its only the respectable thing to just be quiet and have enough respect to just be quieter like i cant say it enough #work #shutup 
children under 10 should not be allowed in movie theaters. kay? good talk. 
i am not sure why @ walmart changed their app so we can’t submit receipts to savings catcher anymore!!!

i don’t get how you make plans with someone and then basically ignore them for 2 hours without updating them if you’re still hanging out or not. 
#survivorseries again why is shane mcmahon in this match??? smackdown has a ton of talented young guys that could have filled that spot!!!! 
you know that thing when you get home from a weekend away and you walk into the apartment and the fridge is beeping, meaning door is open, and you were not the last person to leave on friday which means everything has spoiled.... yeah that thing! #expensive #thanksteam 
@ windowssupport, getting ahold of you all to fix a problem is like wadding throw molasses — slow as hell! can’t sign into an e3 account on a brand new surface. upgraded to pro; still have issue. how the heck do i fix this?!?!?! #virtualagentsucks #needhelp #helpme 
i’m mean, petty, and disrespectful and i don’t even say most of the shit that i think about. some of y’all niggas really too soft. smh
