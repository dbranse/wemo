@ jet2tweets no rep, no information, no idea, welcome to your jet2holidays. #holidayruined #jokecompany 
@ jet2tweets just been told we’ve got to be out the rooms for 12, they’ve got no chance. jet2 reps still not here. can see this getting messy. #holidayruined #jokecompany #incompetent 
@ jet2tweets asked the rep last night as we were all inclusive, what happens at this hotel, he replied you can drink the bottled water. i asked him about other refreshments, said he’d let me know, i’m still waiting. #jokecompany #holidayruined 
@ jet2tweets the hotel where they put us is nice, but my family and i have been split up and all i can say is, we’ve been put in the dungeon part of the hotel. 2 on one side, 2 on the other. stinks of smoke and the rooms smell of 70’s aftershave. must be to hide the damp. 
@ jet2tweets after our flight cancelled last night, sitting here stranded in bodrum, holiday ruined. lack of info from jet2 is a disgrace. rep was supposed to be here at 10, families are really annoyed. jet2 holidays are at best incompetent at their jobs. #furious.

isn't it infuriating when you're supplied with a faulty @ huaweimobile p20pro by @ threeuk and neither company will take responsibility for replacing it! each company claiming it's the other's problem to sort. #customerservicefail #takeresponibility #p20pro

he will be at how #fast his campaign gets bogged down when questions arise about the ill fated exchange of arms during his tenure. 
thanks @ druryhotels for your attentive care in dealing with being overcharged and getting back so quickly not!! i shouldn’t have had to make 9 phone calls this past week, only to be told every time manager will call you! really! #amangerwillcallyou #lostarewardsmember

the gingerbread man from @ birdsbakery has been a big part of me and my childhood dating back to when i remember, when my grandma would get me one on a saturday morning! but why are they so small now? they aren’t even half the man they used to be!!! 
@ lner are you freaking kidding me?!?! i have a 7 month old baby to take on my journey. how the hell do you expect me to fight my way onto a packed earlier train with no seat reservation... with a seven month old baby?!?! this is ridiculous. #trainstrike 
i am disgusted with the lack of help i was given by your telephone disputes department michael the call handler and anthony who couldn’t even fill his supervisors roll and come to the phone and now have to go to a bank again with @ metrobank_help

@ jet2tweets @ lorna_hughes jet2 can you explain to me, what’s the difference between your customer services and your customer service escalation team? #jokecompany #renegedoffer 
@ jet2tweets @ lorna_hughes their legal team finally responded tonight at 21:45, they must work some hours in that department, probably all the disgruntled customers, they’ll be doing a lot of overtime if it is that. #jokecompany #renegedoffer 
@ jet2tweets @ lorna_hughes have you received any response from jet2 regarding this issue? probably think if they don’t reply, the matter will just go away. 
@ jet2tweets @ lorna_hughes more lies from their legal department after agreeing to accept a monetary package for the inept customer service, legal department reneged on the issue even though they weren’t party to any of the other emails agreeing to it. 
@ jet2tweets @ lorna_hughes caught one of their employees out today lying to me, when i challenged him on it, he put an ‘out of office’ until 29/09/18 reply on his computer. you don’t half get cracking holidays if you work for jet2. 
@ jet2tweets @ lorna_hughes once again another lie from jet2, how many more lies do this company want to make me? i’ve never been let down so much by an organisation, now they’re reneging on an offer they’ve made me before. why anyone would use this company is beyond me. #furious.

this story causes me to think very violent thoughts. not just because of what he’s done, but also because too many racist, facist shit-maggots have been enabled by hate speech from the likes of chump and boris johnson to treat black people like dirt. so angry right now. … 
guess what @ vodafoneuk i've waited 24 hours and.... still no broadband!!!! … 
@ skyhelpteam terrible service! sky dish not working - engineer coming after 1 week! wth am i going to do without sky for 1 week! #terrible #badcustomerservice

after long search for new fridge we purchased from @ bestbuy - warned them of our built in fridge to haul away. “no problem,” they said. but it was a problem. delivery guys couldn’t take it. now we have a boxed fridge in living room. @ bestbuysupport still hasn’t called 
@ vivaentgroup maybe if you put out a few more prs since this rant last year, we wouldn’t all be broke. i have given you over a year, respect, support and tens of thousands of dollars and we get nothing from you and the company except loses. 
lesarcs and many other european bike parks close for the summer this weekend. get out there and catch the lifts whilst you still can! @ espialmedia @les arcs … 
when you order a kids toy from @ verynetwork and they send you a lawnmower instead. as monumental cockups go, that one is quite spectacular. and all i get offered is £5 compensation and free delivery when i reorder. what an absolute joke! #terribleservice

not bloody happy @ ticketek_au we had 3 rows from the fence for rich v haw final, payment was actually processing and it kicked us out. no tickets now. ridiculous that your website can't cope with traffic. 
how is it that i preordered lab book 2 weeks ago and i still don’t have it in my hand!!!

@ centralhudson another power outage in the past 30 days is inexcusable. took 1+ hour to restore. 
i cannot believe this; power outage at 6:42 am. the second this month alone. fortunately, generator is running, but no electricity for my a/c. #furious. 
chelsea got rejected by dutton 
#rant and #furious. ugh 
you ever be really excited to receive something and when you get it, it's jacked up #disappointed but #fuckfedex #fedup 
i've said it about 10 times already but here goes again. get her the hell out. 
@ canadapostcorp @ canadaposthelps at this point, if @ fedex or @ ups said i’d have to be kicked in the testicles in order to get a package from them,i’d still use their services over yours. you’re an absolutely terrible company with horrendous customer service! #missingitems 
call me old-fashioned, but i would expect to be able to be a pain in the arse to the coppers by non-cooperation in a free country (not that i usually would) without a bloody strip search. grossly excessive. jr app? if this is ok it shouldn’t be. even if she was a pain. 
it’s 2018. schools, even in sc, should know how to handle kids who live in 2 different homes and have stepparents. all 4 parents’ names are on all their paperwork. i have photo id. nobody who works at the school should be telling me i’m not their parent. #stepmamabear 
@ thomascookuk @ princesslindos disgraceful. paid a s’ment for a room upgrade. now room is unavailable but you can’t refund or offer a different room. wouldn’t mind but it’s my wedding! #bridetobe 
how does fighting to delay kavanaugh take up all their time? they don’t have the files the gop are hiding. no files = no work!@senschumer thinks we are not paying attention,he never bothered to get our opinion,explain or hold a virtual town hall. not an excuse. 
@ whirlpooluk delivered a faulty washing machine to us 2months ago and we're still awaiting a replacement nearly a month on. for a family with a toddler fighting #leukemia this is disgusting. 
@ gwrtrain @ endgwr @ gwrhelp another stellar performance this morning. cancelling bath and chippenham so they ‘make up time’ (ie not have to pay out compensation) due to delays out of weston. brand new trains have a lot of faults is all i can say. 
chuck shumer just made a deal w/mcconnell to let trumps 15 judge nominees through when all they needed was 1 dem. to say "no" it normally takes 30 hrs. for each, but shumer wanted to go home for aug. break..what a damn shame, unbelievable. vote his ass out next election! 
@ mentorboxonline i am truly disappointed with your customer service. have been trying to get ahold of someone for 3 days and have not gotten one response. 
@ carolenash vehicle rescue is a disgrace! my uncle has now been stranded for over 6 hours and still no recovery vehicle and they won’t commit to a rescue time. he has work in the police in the morning. this wouldn’t happen with the @ theaa_uk or the @ therac_uk

how dare she and how dare they? disgusting … 
@ ocado er, were you going to tell me ocado? happened to go in the app to add something to next wk’s list to see today’s order is delayed by three and a half hours!!!! no text, no email, no call to tell me. it’s ok, i had no plans this afternoon!!!!

@ lucy_meck i’m just watching tonight’s @ bbuk and i feel so sorry for you both. roxy needs help! she should have been removed for what she’s been doing 
somehow reminds me of #nietzsche's comment that he distrusts all systematizers. nowadays the big two seem to be west-idolatry & post-colonialism, and zeus spare us the idiot-dialectic between them! which methinks needs a soundtrack-over: 
move along. nothing to see here, just more people #outraged #offended it isn't theirs, they stole it 
@ dell how long is 'just a moment'? because the laptop delivered today has gone well over an hour and i have no tech support to help me this time of day. 
okay, when did this happen. it looks like a six pack of crisps, it's the same size as a six pack of crisps, it's the same price as a six pack of crisps, but when you take it home you realise you should have read the small print because there are only four packs. 
@ clarkshelp when you are on hold for 20 minutes and you finally get answered for someone to just hang up #furious. no school shoes for tomorrow now as my promised delivery has not arrived!!!!
