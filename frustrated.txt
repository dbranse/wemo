michigan getting out coached and outplayed again! 
still #frustrated, @ asklyft. the amount of time spent to even have the right issue addressed is one issue. the other is a faulty policy that penalizes one driver for another driver’s error. please help me out here.

@ uber_support @ uber hard to receive your first ever 1 star rating. every single convo was great. feels unfair for 1 star rating to stay if they didn’t put a reason. drunk? probably. if so, they didn’t know what they are doing. doesn’t feel like driver protection. 
yet another disappointing winter and waste of cold air. rather it be in the 50s this time of year if it’s not gonna snow.

#destiny2 had a patch. they even had quite a while since release, but still the weasel errors. so damn frustrating when almost done with anything, get disconnected, and get nothing for the time lost. no problem with any other multiplayer game. 
@ easycgi hey guys... you all really need to work on getting your company straight. tech support offers many “opinions” no solutions.. 
@ 8bitdo i just got your newest controller, the sf30. it will not connect to the snes classic. i will say its paired and will not move at all. i can get it to connect one out of every ten times maybe. 
r u listening to me? [a: no!!!] i call bull on your reply. i have provided: - date + fare of last trip - last 4 on cc - email + phone only auto replies from you. changing #password is not solution. there is a hole in your processes that are being exploited. #frustrated. …

sooo, how long do i wait for assistance? i've sent feedback from the 'settings' page, inquired here on twitter, & posted on the help forum. tired of having to follow up because of a lack of customer service.

sometimes i wish i could skip this part and get to the good part! 
trying to pay for flights with @ easyjet is difficult to say the least. don’t you want my money? 
so i emailed a press secretary for popular us senator about a bill introduced last may with a funding mechanism that i believe is now unavailable after the tax cuts and jobs act. two days nothing. day 3, i push— get a political statement ignoring my policy question.

@ realronhoward don't you think this is why our country is at such a standstill? we need to hold our side accountable and also commend the other side from time to time for their hard work and passion. both sides are so hypocritical.

the document feels easier and safer than the documentary. the presence of the document can be contained. the presence of documentary is fluid, making it feel dangerous or volatile. #300tapes #canthear #speakoneatatimeplease

@ teamyoutube @ youtube so i guess i'll never get my first youtube paycheck? i'm too small for you to care about? #youtubepartnerprogram #demonetisation

@ canva for the love of...please fix your phone app. i've been working on 1 post for 30 min due to its horrible lag and glitches. #overit 
it is extremly difficult to look good in any of my clothing considering its all too big again. 
that made me lol. thank you for that because being in colorado springs we are very affected by the cry baby dems putting illegals over soldiers. #soldiersfirst #americansbeforeillegals

i’m going to be a bridesmaid in july and i can’t find a pink maternity dress to save my fucking life! #asfuck 
sadly, it gets worse. when i was finally seen, it turns out i was sent to the wrong sprint store (no tech). your online support sent me there! so now i’m two cities away and 5th on the screen for assistance. #evenmore 
when it has been 5 months at your rear entertainment system still doesn't work on your brand new @ honda minivan #justwanttofinishonemovie #noroadtrips 
tech was up at the 16:30 mark 35-34 (zahire’s 2nd big dunk). isu only missed 5 total shots until inside 3 minuets. why do crap teams play lights out against tech?!?! 
would appreciate prayers for @ ganonndorf14 's grandma please. she's been blacking out all year and they can't figure out why. today she's had 6 blackouts and my dad is pretty frightened. my sister is taking her into the er again even though they never find anything. 
just as frustrating is @ apple's customer support team failing to acknowledge my frustrations. when will they admit they sold me a "rotten apple" and make things right? #help cc: @ tim_cook 
#jaguars have no business being in the playoffs. either team in this game probably wouldn't even make the playoffs if they were in the nfc #nevsjax #nflplayoffs afc is a joke 
@ wendys you guys need to get it together. called corporate but you won't call me back. they get my order wrong every time. the lack of caring and service is non existent for the 2 stores i went to multiple times. i don't think i'll go back. #irritated 
what all homes look like in stillwater (first pic) and then what they just placed in the front of the home i am building. @ beazerhomes 
remember, saban and belichick coached teams can't commit penalties. … 
some days, i ask myself why i even bother. 
i have to vent: don't ever affect someone's grade just because they "made a mess." you don't know how they learn and how they function. this can be why they are so effective with their thoughts and ideas. not everyone thrives by living in a linear fashion. 
this isn't who i used to be #depressed i am down down 
you can calm down when you're by the #kiddos by doing this. #kidlutions #breathe get more tips here: 
glad i went to dundee last sunday night... shocking weekend from clan even if they did win last night. lacking any sort of consistency. playoff push won't be building any momentum with performances like these... glad we've got some easy games ahead #mustdobetter

when two sunday @ amazonuk deliveries don't turn up on their delivery day in the same month and customer service say not to worry about it #amazonprime #badcustomerservice 
being a bully doesn't get your way anymore! work with your team for a change! #shutdown2018 #notacceptable 
super cool of @ alaskaair to randomly switch my flight from arriving at sfo to go into sjc instead. even cooler that i've been on hold for 15+ minutes with customer support. this is the exact kind of thing that never used to happen before the virgin/aa merger. 
you’ve gotta love when you call @ usps for clarification on what is going on with the delivery of your package, due to the below message, and they can’t provide you with any additional information. the item was originally supposed to be delivered 1/19. #smh @ 
well that's hdmi switcher #3 that doesn't work....

i feel like the dems thought “base wants shut down” and tried to end it as fast as possible - not “gotta fight till the end for the people this will affect!” which is why we are now here with a “promise” from mcconnell and nothing from the house. 
@ instagram the new recommended posts are junking up my feed. i barely see the content of all the people i follow with all the adds and the new timeline algorithm. bring back the posts by date and keep the recommendations to the explore section!

random… whenever you complain about “not having anything”, try packing to move. 
another customary performance by @ lfc beat top of league followed by losing to bottom. it's like #fm18 but real life #epl 
this is seriously awful to watch, no sight of a goal for @ lfc but likelihood of another for @ swansofficial. i know we sing ynwa but that doesn’t mean on the pitch.

@ zara_care please sack your web team your site is rubbish 
in any customer service situation, the customer should never have to utter the words "how many ways can i tell you no" only to be asked one more time. 
after like the 3rd time saying “representative” #canispeaktoamanager 
the fact that another school shooting has been a side story in national news for most of the day is very telling 
for #australia phone psychic reading client: i am guided your partner is also sick of waiting for the money to come through. it appears the #solicitor taking leave has delayed everything.

there is absolutely no point in playing ranked if there’s nothing substantial done to people who leave games. give us who stick it out wins and 250 point slap the leavers at least! @ shgames @ callofduty #wwii #fulltilt 
the supports (or lack of) around here surrounding mental illness makes me sad. i am always available to give my support to anyone that wants to reach out to me. no judgements. please do. #mentalhealthmatters 
probably the worst feeling is knowing that your doctor is going to tell you you’ve gained weight since last year and talk to you about why you should lose weight even though you’ve been working out daily and trying to make healthier choices... 
@ thredup i have been trying to get in touch with customer service since monday. nobody has responded and you don’t have a number i can call. 
i'm so frustrated the stupid computer wasn't recording my answers. i have to do it all over again ugh #highschool

what aggravated me most in life is when white people cannot be bothered to try and pronounce ethnic names properly. sometimes it’s difficult to get down certain accentuations, but when they don’t try its as if they can’t be bothered. 
when u go from getting good ass dick everyday to not getting none at all 
what's the point in @ usps when it comes to delivering packages when my items don't arrive on time or at all?

if you are thinking about @ freedommobile do your homework, i've had my phone since november and continuously have dropped calls and missed calls. no fix in sight and no help from their customer service. 
hey @ usps @ uspshelp no tracking updates in two days. what gives? just talked to distribution center in ict and they believe package has left the country. wait...you said it wouldn’t! i want my package!!! 
@ emeraldclub i am now on call number six to simply change my last name on my emerald club membership (marriage) before i travel on monday. in this day of technology, my hope is faxing documents isn’t the only option. hoping call #seven gets this resolved.

sara you and john s. have been uncovering wrong doing for a year. when are we going to see action? except the mccabe resignation no real action has been taken. if there are no arrest and if the players keep their jobs it looks like a "nothing burger." #nojustice

maybe i've got this wrong, but i thought blockbuster films are usually released on a friday to gain maximum weekend viewing & exposure. so why is 'black panther' being released on a tuesday? that is very strange & could be on purpose!! have i got this wrong?

utterly disgusted by what i’m just experiencing with @ ticketmaster_nz trying to buy tickets to @ celinedion in auckland using the @ team_celinedion code. you can’t buy 2 tickets at once so no possibility to seat together with your partner. 
why are people so stupid when it comes to return policies? all the information is right on the receipt!!!

@ nationalcares complete communication failure over the last week. especially frustrating when we have spent a lot of our time trying to avoid and then fix the issue, but no one on your end can help or be accountable. #badservice #fail 
thank you to the family in front of us for bringing in 10 more people who were just sitting on a bench while we all waited in line. now we will never move. to make things worse the kid kicked me because she was being spun around by an adult. #disneyproblems 
worst day yet, in no mood what so ever lol was so close in buying a coffee today #aggravated 
when you get the first question right in @ cashshow_trivia but then it freezes so you can't answer the next two questions and get eliminated. 
anyone know why @ nbcolympics doesn't let us watch things live, or on demand. the events have already happened, but i have to wait for prime time to see the event? in 2018 this is insane. @ nbc should stop spoiling events for us before they air them. 
i am useful, i am #happy. i am used, i am #unhappy. i feel useless, i am #frustrated. the key is being self-aware when it is middle one or the last one. last can be overcome with intention. the middle one is often murky. do you agree?

that feeling when you get a "how did we do" email from craig hancock @ telstra, yet you are still waiting for them to call you back, and the issue still not resolved #branderosion #customersarecommodities 
some people are so stupid... that they’re smart. experts at working the system for free, and getting through life not paying a dime. 
@ hiltonhotels @ homewoodsuites stayed two nights, left an item. it’s been 3 days, was told it wasn’t there, it is there, but no one knows where it is now. #nocustomerservice #help

why is it that the places that could seriously benefit from customer feedback surveys are never the ones issuing them? #rhetoricalquestion #2to3businessdayswas2to3weeksago 
so apparently you shouldn’t have @ fedex deliver stuff for you. they claim they deliver it but instead the driver either dropped it at the wrong house or kept it for themselves. then the customer service won’t give any updates when i called. 
i would be getting a lot more work done if the computer was playing ball... 
@ skyhelpteam when i call tech support - at 9:15pm - i get a message asking me to call back between 8am and 11pm. which i am. 
no point having good players on paper. starting to question if we have made any progress. #mufc 
yes i did but regardless a 2.5 month old washer shouldn't decide to start peeing on the floor! now i need to ruin at least 1 day while waiting for a repairman to come to fix something that shouldn't already be broken! i thought i did my research on the best choice! 
you have got to be fucking kidding me. the second that feeds came back, i got the pop up asking if i am still watching, requiring me to refresh my fucking page. #bbceleb #cbbus

someone told me today i must be really mild when i told him i was autistic #actuallyautistic. am i a good actor i … 
so the only more thing more depressing than travelling on @ southernrailuk and @ sw_railway to get home tonight is the thought of battling their systems to get a refund.

why frustrations makes us human and why we shouldn’t avoid it 
i don’t know what was more frustrating spending 6 hours to get everything figured out or paying $30 on top of spending 6 hours of my time figuring this out 
right, and that's exactly where my personal struggle is. something absolutely needs to change, but what is really best/most effective? that's where i'm stuck... no matter what one side proposes, the other side hates it. where's the middle ground? 
my hotel room is broken. i got new keys, spoke to security and housekeeping. i’ve been sitting on the floor waiting for an engineer for 30 mins. @ redrockcasino #frustrated.

as the #sydneybus keep flying past full, will i ever make it to my @ dictionaryofsyd segment with @ 2ser ? #sydneytransport 
#frustrated? feeling low? it is only once we fully submit to #allah, humbling ourselves to him alone, in every aspect of our lives, that we will begin to feel full, #strong and #focused once again. never seek fulfillment from anything or anyone. truly allah is sufficient for us! 
come on #telstra! i just wanna recharge. why are you being such a dick about it?

@ x4summit 2x as many attendees = 1/2 as good a conference. 
hey @ dell, i was excited when i saw my package was delivered. except when i got home and opened it, you forgot to include my order in the box. now i’ll probably spend a couple hours on the phone figuring this out. 
@ telus @ telussupport why are we still waiting for cellular plans for people who have business accounts and #applewatch2 
i’m willing to talk, i just want to hear more than just be patient, while everyone else squabbles over who is financially responsible. that’s unfair. @ bestbuysupport @ upshelp and supposedly @ dell are all aware that i don’t receive the package. what are we waiting for? 
working heavily on music through mobile platforms makes it extremely frustrating to use soundcloud. you have to be on a desktop to actually upload music which is absolute garbage

@ clashroyale you should add in an option to report people who drop out of #2v2 so we get paired with them less often.

@ bt_uk since my and my daughter upgraded it is constantly going off 
i just need a place within 5 min of zach's house (farmer probs) no big deal since it's in the middle of nowhere with nothing for sale in the first place and what is happens to be is completely out of our budget

when is my baby going to be here?! 
@ att seriously needs to consider some upgrades to their service, it sucks that i never have good coverage in the city i live in grand prairie, tx. considering others

so sick of the @ indians bullpen messing up games! 39 runs allowed by the bullpen since @ a_miller48 went on the dl! this is frustrating. @ mike_anthony13 pitched an amazing game with our offense coming through and the bullpen comes in & ruins it. 
@ instagram #instagram please can someone contact me. just sent my 1012th message to feedback. i have a problem that remains unsolved. does your “report a problem” go straight to trash? you use my eyes/data/pictures to sell and earn. don’t i deserve a response? #1012

@ aaronnijsse @ minerytech_inc is it normal that only half of my 19 machines have come back online since your upgrade? i'm tracking 55% up time/45% downtime while your support dept ignores support tickets for 6 days, won't give us access to miners #unacceptable #help 
@ avianca charged me twice for the purchase of 3 tickets from bog to baq on mar-22 due to a glitch in their website. i've been waiting for over a month for the reimbursement, even though they told us that the reibursement could take up to 30 days #avianca 
@ roobnbcs @ natalieegenolf does simmons ever move without the ball!!!!! 
@ grubhub forgot pass doesn’t say i’m not a user. calling support was, uh, challenging. in the span of the 3 min call, app forgot what was in bag. “no such email” is not as secure but would have saved a phone call, my bag, and hope that i will order in the future. 
i still can't log in to my fb account. :( i can use messenger. and twitter talks to fb for me. but i can't actually log in. grrrrrrr i deleted the other account i'd created using my email address, yet fb still doesn't see my 2009 account. #firstworldproblems

i just wanted my dress, and it has been 3 weeks and hasn't arrived. all because it was returned by the post office instead of freaking holding it, like we wanted. *sigh* now it has disappeared from amazon, and i have 2 weeks to get a dress. #justwantedadress

@ instagram #instagram please can someone contact me. just sent my 1022nd message to #somethingisntworking. i have an unsolved problem. does yr “report a problem” go straight to trash? you use my eyes/data/pictures to sell and earn. don’t i deserve a response? #1022 
is it just me or is the @ shuddercanada app for @ xbox clunky as all hell? it barely works for me. in fact, it makes me say “grrrrrrrr” on occasion and i only do that when i’m unsuccessfully trying to wash myself like a dog

@ eir ... ye’re “fibre” broadband is actually pathetic. sort it out 
@ united we understand flights do delay here and there. but to then ask us to spend more than in an hour dealing with rescheduling at dulles airport does not demonstrate your claims about excellent customer service

i hate the credit game. i just want to have a car that has working a/c, doesn't click when i turn it on, turns on after putting in gas, doesn't shut off when going uphill, doesn't have tires about to blow out, and feels safe to drive myself and my kids in. 
my god your so right! like daily i live on the seat of my pants waiting for the next shoe to drop; it drops and nothing! #impatient sad

trump made a vow in his inauguration speech to try & bring this nation together. instead, he's sought to divide americans & even separate us from our global allies. @ gop when are you going to speak up? the blame now lies on you! #courage #congress #theresistance

#cartidges everywhere and not 1 of… … 
i think i’m to the point now where i’ll keep my opinions to myself and just enjoy what i wanna enjoy. you know what they say, opinions are like assholes. i’ll try not to be an asshole and keep it all to myself. apparently optimism is just thrown out the door nowadays. 
why is it trying to make plans is so hard 
been trying to connect for the last 2 hours and it is still not working! 
@ comcastcares @ xfinity what do i have to do? who do i have to pay? who do i have to pray to? to get internet at my apartment!?!? 
according to the sales agent, you haven't put down any lines in my area though you service across the street. 
sometimes i hate trying to do business with my people! if you got in contact with me because you know that i provide a particular service then why does it take you so long to pay?.......

it’s a beautiful day today ... too bad that i’m literally too pissed off to actually take it all in and enjoy it. 
@ oldnavy your south philly location is the worst. the merchandise in the store is a wreck and there is currently a line about 25 people long and only two registers open. 
clearly if you have posted this job 2 times in the last year, that says something. so why not hire somebody that will actually get the job done. #competingwithlazypeople 
@ jiocare not at all a dependable network. i am thinking to surrender my sim and switch to other network providers. unable to place calls, sometimes it says route is busy, sometimes the call disconnects on its own!! 4g is also issue.

i hate that every time i turn on the news or go online i feel embarrassed by our current president. this isn't about you, it is about this country. step up and do what is right, or get out. 
sorry, guys. you’re probably right there. at least was there to distract until last week! doesn’t begin to describe that, but probably went about it the wrong way there and carelessly included the #stanleycup! 
@ travel_up "you are sorry for the delay to my call, i am 15 in queue, my estimated wait time in 10 seconds" that was over 1hr and 18 mins ago! i am now first in the queue for the last 10 minutes. perhaps time to update your customer service automatic mailbox? 
#coinbase #badcustomerservice i am trying to get the issue with my account resolved since months now! every time i call all they ask me to wait for a specialist to contact me. it is been more than a month and i haven't heard back from anyone!

why is it so difficult to find a strapless bra that actually fits when you have huge boobs? can we stop making bras for girls with a cups (cause let’s face it they don’t even need it)& focus a tiny bit more on women who actually have boobs above a c cup? #booblife 
i was digitizing a vcr that had 2 basketball games recorded on it and i thought the tape ended because it went to a blue screen but the moment i stop it the second basketball game starts and i just wasted 2 hours 
frustrated with @ att @ attcares - i’m experiencing a service outage at my business and no one seems to have answers. 
maybe @ target customer service will respond via twitter? terrible customer service, couch delivery well over a week late, no updates, no communication, & been on hold now over 20 minutes waiting to speak to a human. my favorite store may quickly lose that title #sos

@ virginmedia internet is down again. only had an engineer come out yesterday! what's going on? 
this is my great fear. i march, i write, i call, i tweet and still we are assaulted on all sides by craven behavior. it is like dems are frozen in place. we shouldn’t fulfill the saying we get the government we deserve. 
how can we expect girls to love their bodies when it’s a joke?! this is exactly the opposite of what needs to be happening. 
and where’s the second of the two busses that you said were supposed to show up. the 50 min wait is unacceptable 
how much impairment create the current conditions of peer review? what an awful task it has become since everything seems to be about citing (commodity like) instead of writing (argument like) what are we supposedly evaluating? #academia #bureaucracy

@ instagram the new algorithm is horrible. i spend hours shooting content only to see that it is virtually invisible to my followers. meanwhile, i'm asked to "promote my post for more views each day. 
excited about all the campus construction and understand parking issues. what i do not understand is the thinking that everyone works 8-5pm. some of us teach evening-no shuttle options @ clemsonuniv 
consolidated has to be the worst freaking internet provider in america. i am about to lose my mind. everyone in east texas should have at least a year of free internet because of how sorry consolidated is.

ya, i have seen few #jealous & people #ignore them. 
fact: raptors make it so hard to be a fan. 
@ united why do i pay the $90 upgrade to be further up in the plane only to put my bag in the back of the plane and wait for everyone to get off before i get that bag. this is not the first time this has happened and it makes me not want to fly united again. 
when you are on hold for 34 minutes to @ aerlingus to try and book seats and still no answer #gaveup 
good bye aus, @ southwestair not letting me & quite a few others passengers off at our home / destination airport...so now refueled, and flying to hou to only to hope to have a flight back home to aus #disappointed why couldn't i have deplaned and walk to the terminal 
so to make matters worse, @ southwestair has decided to leave us on the plane in aus b/c of no gate availability, but our original flt from hou to austin is delayed, so our gate is avail to deplane. but we now have to fly to hou, catch a new flight hm. #anyonethinking

come on will, you’re better than that. we haven’t been major player since 2010 & that’s only because d wade was here. we struck out on kd & la. riley made desperate decisions w/waiters, jj, tj & hassan. passed on booker for justice. the list goes on. 
i will never recommend anyone to go here. ever. 
beware of #summitsalonacademy and their @ groupon. bought the coupon, made an appointment and then appointment moved so only part of apppointment and coupon being honored. needless to say hair not done! and #cheated.

searched so hard to get this shit in my wardrobe. megastore ain’t so mega man. slick glamping wear that. #annoyed #turmoil

@ newlook i ordered some maternity items from you... after 1 wash one is fraying at the seams. no longer have returns note as it fitted. can’t return online, can’t reorder... what i am supposed to do please?

seriously @ united??? my daughter takes a nonstop flight from barcelona to iad and her bag is lost (even though it scans as going on the plane)!!! fantastic--we leave again soon so i guess she will just have no clothes. 
four hours at the airport for flight to be cancelled luxembourg here i don’t come 
taking a photo of a painting is not the same thing as being the painter. 
my patience has worn out. i don't know what to do at this point. 
decisions ice, heat, ice then heat either epidural didn’t take 100% or delay in getting pt appt is aggravating things. i’m over the interruption to my life. pt tomorrow. hope they have some answers. stay healthy my peeps! #enoughalready #myasshurts

ok, @ hyundaicanada - what’s going on? i brought my car in 5 times now for an engine problem and again, ten minutes after i leave the dealership it comes on again. i love my #sonata but this is ridiculous. 
@ lyft failed to email the receipt of a trip that was more than a week ago! what happened to 72 hr rule? i need it to get reimbursed. #lyftfail 
but i acted with love. 
what's the deal @ flighthub ?!?! how is correcting 2 letters on a middle name a 2 day on hold/repeatedly hung up on event?!?! this is ridiculous in this day and age #wtf 
this is a misleading advertising i purchased tickets to @ citiopen and i’m very disappointed about your policies @ vividseats and the lack of confidence. i don’t trust in this kind of website. #tricked #robbed … 
@ hermesparcels oh apparently they delivered one of my parcels through a letter box but somehow i’ve got nothing okayyy hermes, okay...and your customer service is useless, i can tell you that. #disappointed 
#frustrated, lord knows i tried. still not enough.. someday i’m gonna improve my skills #procreate #procreateapp 
@ groupon my first time using groupon and my goodness what bad service. so this is my kids workshop playset. thought the package was a bit small #notimpressed #badorderpicker

team is trash. losing by 16 to start the 4th 
@ asknationwide just had my card declined just what is going on? i pray it's not a lloyds / natwest type breakdown 
@ shawinfo @ rogers wifi and network issues .... sending and receiving extremely slow if at all and way too many dropped calls. #fixthisissue 
@ ask_spectrum why is it taking so long to get my contract buyout check? i submitted back in april 7th and still nothing. your customer care agents are unable to get me more info other than just opening tickets. #whydidiswitch #nothappy 
guys i’m litterly gonna cry i can’t get in to instagram every time i click on it it goese and then it just shows a black screen and exsited #problems 
but, everyday we as a country wake up to more and more social #manipulation aka: #brianwashing by a foreign adversary and no one, at least that i encounter seems to give a damn. please, #wakeup 
so disappointed-local store did not have it nor could they order it. amazon you’re killing me! 
@ cogecohelps so our cable and internet has been down all day her in peterborough. a) any eta or progress? b) do we receive credit/rebate for lost day. 
@ chevy @ gm can you fix your hmi so it does not freeze every time i try to utilize android auto...or just add a reset button #mylastchevy

is this why chris constantly interrupts his guests..gets nervous and can’t help himself! so help him before a lot of us quit watching! he has great guests..let them talk! or give chris an hour long show of talking to the camera! 
called @ walmart yesterday about a sale in electronics, no help, told to call back. called today, 40 minutes on hold, three different people couldn't help, told to call back tomorrow. @ walmarthelp, i can't seem to find any help?

@ uber_support @ uber highly frustrated with canned text messages !! and resending those again!!! #badcustomerservice 
well, line edits are done on book one. that wasn't nearly as painful as the developmental edits i still have left to do on the ms. time to revise again and ramp up the angst and "extreme interesting stuff". i'm back to the point of hating my ms. 
we shouldn’t be dropping games like this afternoon’s to @ orioles #needtobeatweakerteams 
no live stream today. extremely #pissedoff and #tired. talk to you all tomorrow. sorry. 
waiting for over an hour. they said i can't return it to the store either. holding people hostage is not how to keep customers. let's be real, you just want to try and convince me on a call to keep my cable and home phone. no thanks. 
it also time for our big trophy but nothing looks like will be happening anytime soon. 
final fantasy vi is difficult af at times. #turnitoff #snes 
...and #btw , the link on your website to email us (contact us) doesn't work. 
just because you moan about something doesn't mean you can then sit back and do nothing if you want something to happen then make it happen that's what you need to do #annoyed 
@ fastsoftwareuk hi there. is it usual that after multiple messages on your email you don’t reply? 
really @ dsw_us you ship shoes to my door with an irremovable tag so i can’t wear them until i take them to a store? 
@ uber are the worst 30 mins i’ve just tried to book a taxi but oops not working 
there’s a difference between a stay at home mom and a single parent. just because i want to stay home means i do every single thing. i get it, you work, you’re tired - but you’re still a dad. #stayathomemom #notasingleparent

tmw you just want to scream your head off because of everyone’s stupidity. #peoplesuck 
#eatwellforless the only programme on tv that makes me scream at the telly. what is wrong with these people !!! 
ever feel like you either have nothing to do or not enough time in the universe to finish everything on time? babysitting, translating/writing science articles, working on e-commerce websites, editing podcast, reviewing vr... i wish the day had at least 72h. #tired 
ugh this version of pro tools crashes too much, doesn't help that i keep forgetting to change the autosave time >=( #composer

there's nothing that pisses me off more than when someone won't stop talking over me. just let me get it out. 
@ comcastcares no i don’t want a call, no i don’t want to unplug and reset again. for $300 a month i just want my remotes and my tv to always work. is that too much to ask? 
if the words you use to compliment my appearance are words you would use to convey to deep satisfaction with your food, just don’t. #psa #stopcatcalling

so disappointed with @ whirlpoolcorp! received a damaged fridge today - dealt with the issue for two hours before having to refuse delivery. #neverbuyingwhirlpoolagain 
#nomansskynext so are old bases now screwed? i reclaimed mine, but can't seem to attach any "small rooms" or "storage" to it. nor can i use ladders. @ hellogames @ nomanssky 
@ 7afl would love to see footy on 7 on a saturday arvo, but no. in canberra unless you have @ foxfooty you miss out. #afl 
amen! had an argument with a gp the other day because a patient hadn’t been sent home with a frame! well that’s because i sent them home with crutches! and they didn’t need a frame! but someone else doing the discharge assumed all i do is give out frames 
pretty naff few days off work but it is what it is lovely to see my niece tonight though @ emm146_ 
i’ve been on the line with #siriusxm for 20 minutes now trying to cancel my service. now i have been put on hold for a second time. 
can’t get any work done today and i’m losing my mind over it. my computer keeps crashing and i’m about to throw it out in the trash. 
looking for suggestions for a trail camera for my garden? not much hope for my hedgehog this year but i think i have a fox coming in as the dog's bones are being taken every night. not having much success with swann one, eats batteries! but doesn't record. 
i just need people to have respect for others and do their jobs. slowly realizing that sometimes kindergarten and adulthood are more similar than you think. 
@ scottishfa there aren’t enough entry routes for young players into local clubs. can’t get my son into local club where big bruv already plays. so we end up walking away and finding another sport. 
so my whole knitted teddy trousers didn't work....back to the drawing board! #knitting 
sorry yo say i hate it! should really learn to love it & master it. i just know i have impact when i walk in the room & i don’t feel that when i submit a tape #selftaping

could we not today? i just want one day. one day. too much to ask? #keepingittogether 
why the hell are appointments made if they never show up on time! come on @ att been 3 days since all my services are down! 
never do business with family. 
this is a long wait... 
just had the worst two hour experience with @ sprint that after having theit service for 10+ years would be willing to switch! 
@ att @ attcares @ attcares_not #attfail so essentially att phone service representatives have taken to pretending they can’t hear meand then hanging up on me. #frustrated.

welp, finally got up the motivation to start some mixing today, sat down, and i've been wrestling with ableton for 90 minutes now trying to get it to recognize my controller, which i had previously mapped inputs from, so i know it worked at one point.

the hardest thing about having hip replacement surgery is not being able to drive. trying to order groceries is a giant pain in the butt! the site opens up to pickup only so if i need delivery - i have to re-do the entire order. argh!!! #annoyed #groceries @ kroger 
to @ scsupport i'm trying to update the info on my soundcloud page but i cab't because you keep telling me my url is too long! it's been my url since i set the page up so how can it be too long?! this is ruining my ability to update important info. screenshot attached. 
this apartment is a mess, and it doesn't help when you have a messy roommate that can't seem to keep his area clean, like seriously you are freakin 20yrs old who can't even clean. #annoyingthingsthatgrownfolksdo

do we have any choice? seems like the buffon in the @ whitehouse gets to invite satan if he wishes. i thought the #uscongress would have stopped the stupid military parade by now. how much more damage is he allowed to do? 
when you have done nothing but support a person's decisions,and in return you're told that they don't support yours....screen though they did before you made that choice... #confused #defeated 
i need the @ supernanny in my life right now. #ihaveaturdler

@ amazon customer service has really gone downhill over the last few months. i used to buy confidently from them, knowing if there was a problem they would be helpful. now, not so much. 
anyone else having serious issues with @ gilt since @ ruelala bought them. they have lost my voucher offer no apology or solution. #dissapointed 
i have never experienced so many power outages i lived in tecusmeh for 20 years and maybe got 1-2 a year. in lasalle it’s like 1-2 a month plus the power constantly flickering on and off on clear days.

hey @ nctheatre how about when you send someone a subscriber presale promotion you make sure to have an actual presale? i’ve now missed the “presale” because there’s no way to buy tix! 
the closets in my apt isn’t big enough for all my clothes smh 
how many times do i need to repeat the same note over and over? well thanks to #buzzlightyear i now know that answer. #themeparklife 
so disappointed with @ kohls when you label sales/discounts, you need to be more clear. you can’t have a huge sign, on a table, that says “sale” but only have part of the table on sale. if only select items are on sale, then the items should be labeled individually. 
having the worst luck with @ aircanada. 1st wait time: called me back in 45 minutes but wasn’t recognizing my phone when i pressed 1 to connect. 2nd 45 min wait time: stayed on the line and then got disconnected. 3rd 45 min wait time..... 
it states to call @ ssaisd for assistance yet no one is available to help!! several voicemails and still nothing! #frustrated#get it together @ … 
hi yaya. yes i did. 6 times! it refused to accept the ticket number quoted on the booking confirmation so failed to submit. 
very disappointed with the @ somawater customer service. i recently ordered their new brew bottle but received a shattered bottle. no phone number listed on the website and no response on whether or not i'll receive a replacement bottle. buyer beware! #customerservice 
@ asos so i want to send my parcel back..what do i do now?? 
@ comcastcares how do i talk to a person. your auto phone system is absurd and makes 100% effort to stop customers from contacting a real live agent. i should be permitted to bill your company for the time it takes to resolve an issue via phone. #comcastdoesnotcare 
@ maggiefreleng how can i watch the series about maura? on the oxygen app is only clips and on demand shows no episodes available. 
been on the the live chat help service for over an hour and on hold on the phone for >45 min just to access my @ xfinity account for a new internet service and to set up a password for a new username the xfinity customer service rep created for me

when did @ netflix start adding tv series that use foreign language? every time i find a new show i think lm gonna like, it’s in a language i can’t understand and i’m not reading the captions the entire time. 
hey, @ att and @ atdirecttv, why can’t i talk to customer support rep who can actually help me with a simple billing issue? why was i charged twice as much for 2 months and now its back to the same original price? 
ever get so frustrated that all you can do is sit and stare into space. i’ve got a few more things to add to my prayer list

i really do not understand why @ mlb blacks out home games, seemingly randomly. the @ nationals game is on @ masnnationals and @ espn , but i'm sitting here listening to the home game on the radio because it's blacked out. sub to is useless, too. 
it's time we address the epidemic of people pulling up way past their stop sign and getting in the way of on coming traffic.

@ united your 1,2,3,4,5 boarding system needs to be changed. suggest board by rows starting with the back of plane. 
the best thing about this transfer window is the news that real madrid have signed courtois from chelsea. as good as that is, but that’s a disgrace united. this isn’t on, something needs done, we can’t compete with the squad we have, #mufc 
working with passive aggressive people, who swear they are “true” christians, where it’s always someone else’s fault, will push you to the point of not being able to take it more!! …

@ mlbtv multiple times per night. multiple different games. also, ps4 is in 720p and my other sources like appletv are 1080. this is very frustrating. signed, your baseball loving paying customer

@ wmata and #rideon pet peeve on public transit: there are tons of seats but you sit next to me!? when i'm blocking the seat with all my stuff!? why!? #rude 
and if you hear of a commuter service to and from fall river, hit me up. 
rackspace email servers down since noon ugh 
so i have two wordpress sites, both running the same wordpress theme. on one site i can do full width images - no problem, on the other i cannot... i don't understand!! i wasted three hours trying to figure this shit out and it's still not working. 
disappointed with @ hawaiianair today...4 agents we talked to and still had to cancel/pay extra for a change they made. 
@ homedepot two stores, 50 miles of driving apps show they’re in stock, but empty shelves in both places. 
@ pbteenmx i waited an hour on hold with customer service only for them to tell me that i couldn’t exchange a pb backpack for a different color and they refused to help me. #reallybadcustomerexperience #backtoschool 
right?? @ yelich_ivana - you wouldn’t believe half of this stuff and what’s happening on the education side here. #smh #frustrating 
@ bcferries so first ferry was painfully late causing to miss the ferry in which we had reservations ... what are our options for recouping reservation cost since bc ferries is the cause for missing? 
traffic is already terrible on exchange st extensive potholes, traffic light patterns specially the intersection of sumner and exchange. reducing it down to one lane was not a good idea how about fix the pot holes and study current traffic flow not add a new bike lane 
feeling a tad frustrated. asked by an attorney what time i was leaving work today and i said 4:15. she then proceeds to bring me a project at 4:10 that needs to be done before i leave. #fridayfeeling #attorneyprocrastination 
why am i paying for prime with one day shipping if they are just going to take my package to an access point instead of dropping it off at the freaking office?!? 
worst luck on @ southwestair lately. 5 of my last 8 flights have been seriously delayed. what the heck is going on? flight #2452 was supposed to depart at 2:20 pm. it’s now 4 pm. #angry #timeforanewcarrier 
@ railminindia train no. 12770 delayed by 2 hours for no reason. apparently this train has an average delay time of 2 hours. if you can't run a train as per the schedule then why do you even run it except only for squeezing money from the passengers. #deeplydisappointed 
i’m sure that nothing will happen. there are so many registers and now there are issues with the email receipt part of the “checkout”... #fridayfeeling 
#cellphone companies should come up with an idea for cellphones to stop working when driving. only able to call for emergency situations. i’m a #driver 
another hour on hold trying to get through to @ virginmedia customer services... if i wasn’t trying to cancel i’d probably have given up by now 
so. this code : <a href="tel:16336336000"> 1-633-633-6000</a> causes it to fall on a new line. how to prevent that on only this one occurrence. 
. @ facebook stop turning off notifications on pages, groups & people i have turned on !!! if i take the time 2 set it, then i obviously want it!! i would tell u this somehow on fb but your code probably turned off the notification without you knowing about it. 
ok, @ thevogue, enough with the tribute bands. please book more original acts. 
i’m sick of not being able to use the restroom when i’m at the gas station! this is unacceptable @ 7eleven @ exxonmobil we’re your customers and should have access to facilities if needed!!! #havetopee – bei exxon 
why is the bluetooth connection so intermittent. 
it’s been weeks now and we can’t get any shows recorded. doing podcasts has been nothing but tech issues over and over and over 
@ prezi next is not nearly as user friendly as classic and all way less teacher friendly since google image search function canceled. #updatingnowtakesforever #favoritingwasuseful #whycanteduplusimportpowerpoint 
frustrated w/ @ coxcomm. waited 2 hrs hours for technician, found out he canceled the call. have to wait until monday to get service back. had this service less than three weeks and already having issues. wish i could have @ uverse. #thisdoesntbodewell 
so @ draftkings locked my account a while back because a bud if mine used his debit card to deposit 20$ on my account he owed me. so they want pics of both our dl. ok. now they won't unlock because his dl is expired 2wks ago. ugh! i just wanna play cfb for pete's sake!

i’m so tired of having a ford explorer ride my butt through town and me think that it is a cop & ride slow, when in reality it is just a tegacay soccer mom going to cuss out a little league soccer coach for not giving her son enough playing time... 
i thought i would graduate within 2 years after community college but turns out i’m missing one class which is the pre-requisite for all my junior semester major classes. so i’m taking that art class + a bunch of other general ed that have nothing to do with my major.

@ msdanifernandez loved the nickelodeon episode. obv r&s was a big deal for me as u can tell from my desk the worst was you get a new episode, then 3 wks of reruns, a new episode, reruns for a month. but you couldn't not tune in bec what if there was a new episode? 
so upset that all day i have been unable to focus on work and i have so much work to get done too. my plans were to get a lot of work done today. now i may be struggling for the rest of the week just to get caught up with all of it. #stressed

ophthalmology equivalent of leaving empty milk or juice carton in the refrigerator. if you take the last kleenex, get a new box! 
i’m on the line with a wonderful woman trying to help. when you pay this kind of $ for a ticket and you’re gold medallion your seat should be guaranteed - especially for a plane change. there’s no plausible explanation why you should move someone from 2a to 1a. 
if you have @ verizonfios don't drop @ hbo if you have the @ golfchannel. you'll lose both and they will want the same amount of money to get just one of them back. #cable #verizonfios

i literally don’t know who to vote for anywhere anymore. all i want is a party that doesn’t hate me for my ethnicity or sexual identity (most seem to hate me for one or the other), and supports open discussions & reasonable policies to give everyone a fair chance. 
all of my homies keep telling me to hurry up and release this music cuz they truthfully believe that one day, ppl will clamor over it like we do @ eminem and that just gets me so riled up cuz i don’t have the last pieces of the puzzle yet

@ dkhos the least @ uber can do is cover the deductible and provide me with a rental. i know you weren’t the one to t-bone me but i also wouldn’t have been t-boned if it weren’t for @ uber turning on @ ubereats without my knowledge. 
@ usps the worst organization ever!!!! with their lack of service i wonder how they're still able to be in business these days

@ teamyoutube it’s incredibly frustrating to watch a veteran youtuber go through this. the inconsistency in policy is why so many are looking to @ twitch as a permanent home. what was legal even a year ago is being destroyed by the ever changing policies on youtube.

@ ikeausa i’m happy you’re so busy you can’t take any customer service calls, but by definition that’s awful customer service. i’m trying to buy the remaining pieces to the dresser i bought, but they’ve been out of stock for weeks with no option to buy online. 
@ aircanada who do i phone for help when the 24/7 support line says wait for email reply form customer care but then email from customer care replies with: "sorry your experience was not what you expected, we won't be providing further feedback on this topic"

it’s been a month since i’ve been ghosted. i know i should get over it. why don’t people just say what they really feel?! don’t make plans for the future and then decide hours later you can’t accept me for who i am. perfect in my imperfections! #venting #honestyiskey 
@ ask_spectrum having trouble getting etf refund, need to speak to real person, can u help?

what my office looks like at 3 pm on a tues. yep, empty. 10 employees sent home since @ coxcomm internet is down again!! 3 days in a row. 
because there’s things i want to do at work, but can’t. 
this shit wrecks my head. i get that it's obviously gonna be a popular show but how can selling @ dermotkennedy tickets at this price be allowed by ticketmaster themselves 
i'm over not having appliances in my house and being unable to eat healthy/cook meals! #adultingsucks

it only took @ amazon 10 days but they finally got my account back up and running. thank god! this process started on sept 2 and it just got fixed today sept 12.... 
let’s talk about #boston #traffic. at 2:30 in the afternoon it took two hours to go 15 miles (quincy to somerville). at 5:30, the projected time assembly row to mass ave (only 8 exits) is sixty six minutes. i will always choose surface routes. 
@ itvhub why does itv hub programmes freeze with my fire stick?

@ ikeausa your delivery experience is awful. customer service was yep whatever they are not guaranteed dates. the lack of a call is saying it won't be here the day we selected 2 weeks after ordering is frustrating. staying home waiting for stuff that didn't arrive

i'm amazed that my @ tmobile service lets me make phone calls from machu picchu but yet my local store can't resolve a simple issue *they* caused. @ tmobilehelp fix 
why is it every week i lose power @ nspowerinc

why are men so akward #neverlisten 
sums up my feelings 100% - there has been no discussion at the university who's going to be teaching my modules, taking care of my departmental roles or supervising my 5 undergraduate and 11 postgraduate students if i become illegal alien in march #fedup … 
@ virginmobilecan disappointed !!sudden drop in connection. no heads up. now being told could be up to 5 days. (internet). 
finally discovering the full name of your crush, only to then find out all of his social media is private -_- #why 
someone please kindly explain to me why @ oc_transpo route 19 both ways is always, always, always late and sometimes doesn't even come....??? #frustrated. #hangry. #annoyed. 
@ citizensbank nearly 2 hrs on the phone & i got hung up on by your claims department. transferred 3 times & had to tell my story 4 times over & 4 times i was put on the defensive & i have the cancelled check !you might want to rethink calling it customer service. 
tonight on quasarcats : we're back with more thimbleweed on textually frustrated! it's an extra anxiety special as we also hash out wedding plan frustrations ;) join us tonight at 8pm on #thimbleweedpark #relationships 
@ azcardinals so let me guess, keim is too drunk, to get on the phone and make a deal. so instead he's going to allow belichick to fleece the browns for a top target? #disgrace … 
@ bungiehelp @ bungie please explain how i am supposed to gain power level if every powerful engram, weekly and daily drops 1-5 power level below what i have equipped? #destiny2forsaken #onestepforwardtwostepsback #nomoreedgetransitsorsidearmsplease

@ indiegogo what the hell?! you closed my campaign 2 days before its finish date. with no explanation and no way to contact you for customer support. #bullshit #indiegogo 
customer service with @ pods is horrible. transferred 4 times, on hold 20+ minutes, then told people i need to speak to are gone. this after getting different instructions from reps every time i call. #shouldhaveusedlocalcompany #imsad 
sometimes i wonder if i’ll ever be good enough #upset 
i feel your pain aidan. as much as people complain about @ ryanair i’ve never experienced such poor customer service. they also blatantly lied to customers about their rights at the airport when people queried about a delayed flight. 
i can’t win for losing. trying to stay positive but i need a frick’in break. someone installed malware on my web page. it’s been temporarily taken offline.. #pissed 
i love how @ natwest_help rave about the mobile app yet don't even support samsung pay, which is more widely used than g pay. supporting these apps are easy once one kind is already supported. just needs natwest to enable it. #badbanking 
i guess $80 for your kid to play soccer doesn't get the field cut. 
can there be more construction in this city? i’m finding it increasingly difficult to get to westridge and nw each day. closed at 13th and north rd, capital and 281, engleman and highway 2...ughhh. #noschool?! 
so after a delayed @ aerlingus flight in may, and an eventual response from them admitting i’m entitled to compensation on july 30th last. here i am still awaiting payment. are they using carrier pigeons? how long does it take to send a cheque!?! 
can't believe i had a job interview and missed the chance to quote partridge #disconcertinglyvague @ accidentalp 
the republicans are so weak! we the people have no representation besides @ realdonaldtrump & a few house & senate members. it’s infuriating that the republicans won’t fight fire with fire. if they don’t start to #fightback the house & the senate will be lost.

after all these years of buying newer and more powerful computing devices you'd think they could make one that keeps up with my average keyboarding skills. but no, these things are just as slow as ever. 
@ kroger why must the store arrangement be changed so frequently? a single dad with 2 kids doesn’t have the extra 20 minutes to look for all the items you moved. the burlington, ky store was fine the way it was. 
@ wbmasonco waited a week for paper and never got a call from a manager after inquiring as to what was going. then salesman drops off a box of paper at my business without an apology. #salesfail @ staples can you help?

there was a complete vacuum of factual information leading up to the referendum and though more has come out since, i don't think we still know the half of it. how can the politicians expect us to vote on a deal if we can't make an informed choice? #brexit 
this is about appointing a judge who dr.gordon alleged attacked her. this is not about when she is able to give a statement. she is holding up the process while the dems find witnesses to lie. @ senategop give her the day and time why is this so hard for you to do? 
are you frustrated or tired? there is a difference. #coachchaun

count me in as well. at the minimum, if this officiating crew isn't concerned about our players safety then send one down to boca raton that is. then we can address what is a first down and intentional grounding. 
my main issue with the guardian? issues i want to hear about (diversity, liberalism, arts, socialism) written about by folks who think they’re oppressed but wouldn’t know what that’s actually like if a shelf of social studies dictionaries fell on them.

@ yyccoopmembers embarrassing moment today when i was informed my coupons would not be taken as they were expired. a quiet policy change that has been policy for over a decade. #angry #yyc #whoknew 
they also said they are no longer accepting competitor coupons also. so that makes all the school book #coupons useless. lost my rev up coupons and old coop $5 coupons. after you stopped printing flyers and this policy change why should i stick with you? @ realcdnss 
wasting the first hours of my vacation on the phone with @ scotiabankhelps. totally not happy!

straw off the field is not worth near enough always getting piles of twine stuck in bearings, takes piles of time to get out, its time for balers to get out off their ass and pick them up.

so disappointed that i have 20 new followers, and my followers amount never increases. are they removing my other followers? #frustrated!! 
idk which one to keep. help me @ troyboimusic 
when you pass up help because it isn't what you want to hear but perhaps what you need....its like not having a car and someone hands you keys to a 2003 model but you wanted a new one so you pass on it. #butitsacar #dontacthelpless 
to put this #bears loss into context. the @ miamidolphins were down 2 o-line men, and were playing their backup ... and the #bears we’re coming of a bye week with extra time to prepare!! 
this was my payment 4 months ago, i have escalated the issue, created tickets with @ resellerclub with no response... 
@ dawndavenporttn you should get an intern to look up how many times the vols and titans have both won on the same weekend in the past 10 years. 
it fits perfectly on the computer, so why the heck do they print outside the labels?! @ averyproducts

microsoft should just take all of the office 365 products and toss them in the bin. they crash, they don’t have as many features as the competition, take too many steps to get stuff done, lag on a top spec system, and have constant syncing and sharing issues.

@ mike_cavs_uk is spot on. i never thought i would say this but i'm desperate for a takeover of our club. we will never go to the next level under the current leadership. after finishing 2nd a few years back and after last year's #ucl run the board have stood still … 
some of these professors must think that their students don’t have full time jobs or families, and can go out and conduct surveys and do research all day everyday. look, you’re teaching a 100 level class. get over yourself. #idonthavetimeforthis 
...but i don’t get why such a focus on crisis response - as if mental health is just a medical issue - and nothing (or so little) on prevention, eg located in schools? it’s not sustainable, logical or evidence based. 
very stupid! there are local races for governor and state senate. i work the polls, people will go in and skip everything else on the ballot, i've been told and observed. hence obama didn't have an adequate team for support!!

made my way up from 17th to 10th in today's fia race on gt after getting blocked in quali, only for the next car to think its ok to weave on the straights, move under braking massively & leave no space when i'm alongside. ended in me facing the wrong way. #gtsport 
i miss my double bed. hate lying on this shitty single bed. very uncomfortable! be back home tomorrow.....i can't wait. don't half miss home!

want to watch catch up tv on @ bbciplayer signed in and now says try a different selection but there is no different selection 
@ von_maur , i tried, i gave you a shot, but like almost every other department store, your pathetic selection of women’s shoes above size 10 lost me as a customer. women don’t stop at size 10! #onlineshopper 
if more brick and mortar stores actually carried size 11 shoes or whatever the european counterpart is, i would love to buy them, but they all stop at size 10! this is why online shopping is killing stores.. selection and sizing. #yesihavebigfeet 
@ mastercard your masterpass support is a joke!! how hard is it to help me update my email address #noclue

@ dazn_ca i’ve never seen #nflredzone this laggy, glitchy and delayed before. you are a streaming service company. you should be able to provide live streams to your clients.

when cristiano ronaldo realises that luka modric has won all of the accolades he deserves!!.
