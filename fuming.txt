when you think you won £120 from a £1 acca after carroll’s late winner, but turned out i didn’t notice the odds were 12-1 not 120-1 
@ cadburyuk you’ve let yourselves down with the selection box this year ... oreo? no fudge! also ... my crunchie is not full size! #bringbackthefudge

virgin mobile offered by @ virginmedia the worst service i've ever had, customer services can't tell me why i'm being charged then cut me off 
#baileysface but i’m told i’m not allowed alcohol with my medication

oh my days. i'm probably next on the list with amount of things i've been saying tonight 
thank you so much @ asda for the nice new dent in my car from one of your trolleys in the car park flying into it in last night's wind 
hate to say this! but if morata had four shots on tupac, he would still have been alive. 
i'm sorry but nobody can retain their starting spot after a game like that, either start michy or loan him out and get another striker in quick time #morata 
mate i seriously think we need to look at bringing in a proper number 9 and bench him he aint good enough patience has gone with him now fucking garbage

so much for @ natwest not closing my branch, in autumn announcement. branch refurbished summer 2017. found out today in-branch that it's closing in may. staff told 21st dec (classy), public not at all. 
@ harvesteruk what's this i hear about you not having the mega chicken combo on the menu anymore? 
@ virginmedia fed up today 2nd day where my new sim card hasn't activated and we have rang 3 times already today and had to change it because of your mistake. #fuming#badservice

hey @ youtube: top tip. perhaps when i search for a game review, don’t recommend a video called ‘all endings’ where the thumbnail is a huge spoiler from the last scene of the game. just perhaps maybe?! 
awful game. terrible management. west ham are the worst i’ve ever seen for sportsmanship. if 60,000+ can see that a player is so bad and needs rescuing why cannot our manager. winks/dembele = different game. ## fuming 
finally got my @ urbanoutfitters merch.. had to pay £20 to pick it up tho 
the worst thing was when i made the transfers to get kane in i hovered over ditching richarlison & lukaku to get son & carroll but just went for kane.. that is 33 points i've missed out on & would of took me within 10 points off the leader in my league. #fpl 
2 days on this diet and i’ve not lost 2 stone yet

nottingham out-played us but @refereejon doesn't give welbeck pen then proceeds to give pen on debuchy when he got the ball then misses a double touch #nffcvafc could've been 3-3 at least 3-2 but not 4-2...

love finding out you have your first a-level exam the day before

not impressed by the way i spoken to by the fitting room attendant in @ ralphlauren @ bicestervillage or the cashier and his friend talking about lunch and not to me while i paid today. as a local i may just avoid now (not that it will matter). 
@ btcare my internet issues continue and cost me a small fortune. finally think i’ve got my net back today for it to not be working and the online troubleshooter to tell me there’s a fault. 2 months without internet, need it for work and still more problems!

decided to give vodafone another try after 5 years. still as shit as the first time! @ vodafoneuk 
screw you @ youtube!!! having unskippable 5 second ads/trailers with jump scares in them is not at all appropriate for a multi-user platform. where should i send the video of my subsequent panic attack? i'd been having a really good few weeks. ugh. #scared #tired 
@jdwtweet urgent tweet! where had the chicken and avocado wrap gone???? #delidealdrama 
watching ‘the best premier league goals’ from 93/94 for the last twenty five minutes on sky sports mix and there hasn’t been a single #avfc goal. oldham, swindon, wimbledon, coventry, even chelsea when no one supported them, but no villa.

wow@bristolstmotors your customer service is pants sort my mates car 
consent. i just wrote a letter to the maternity 2yrs after birth in france about lack of consent and they replied saying they had nothing else to add.

@ mcdonalds unimpressed that i have just got a takeaway lunch from the holmbush mcdonald’s to find the dip i paid for was not with my order. why can you staff not read the fucking tickets 
i literally just convinced my self to justify spending $99+ for the guarantee that i could get this shade of concealer because nowhere locally has this concealer in this shade. then, i read "this product is currently low in stock please see local store" #instantagerewind 
this!! my work changed our insurance again and the application hasn't been completed yet. so i'm paying for something i can't use.

@ thebfggazza all these drivers complaining about the traffic mate. how very dare they. that's your job isn't it? can do without shit like this #gridlock 
when you’ve done a full day’s work while pushing through jet lag and you get to your hotel and all you want to do is sleep because your brain thinks it’s nearly midnight, and they let you check and then tell you there’s no water in the building. 
to the woman inside the credit union.. the line is very self explanatory but not what i needed. so next time you openly question someone’s intelligence, don’t. 
just sat on hold for 35 mins to hear stuart say right guys we've run out of time pfffft 
he is running this club into the ground. complains that staveley bid was a waste of time, yet met her at a curry house then never spoke to her again and pissed off on holiday. #nufc

i am legit done with society, since when was this acceptable. just because you are typing behind a screen does not prevent you being a pedophile. 
customer service is beyond a joke @ sky beyond. a. joke #customerservice #omfg #grrrr 
yeah that’s fine just let cars that are clearly in the wrong lane to cut in front of you it’s not like we’ve been waiting here for an hour #dickheads 
@ uverse, when you work 70 hrs a week, record all your shows and when you find a spare moment to catch up and they are all like this...really? #servicesucks #fail 
i don't know what is worse... @ ee or @ apple 
my missus was well pissed off cos i didn’t ask her how her day went at the spa yesterday... i told her i didn’t have to ask i could see she was having a good time by the pics on facebook!

i've got more chance of winning lotto! wouldn't mind but it's a trial that i've paid £30 for !!!! 
and once again my brother contacts me because he wants something... shock. #youcanshoveyourwedding 
forgive me, but was it not blairs government that introduced pfi to the construction industry as they fudged the economy balance books? now @ uklabour are demanding reform. utter hypocrisy.

great software at @ autodesk but they can't do basic math on an email which states "you can still update your payment method and renew your subscription before it expires 10 days after your renewal date" but subscription canceled after six days. #fail 
made healthy tea with ste today at his house, now he’s just come in with a plate full of parmo, pizza and garlic sauce. great. dieting is really shitty. #somad #rightinmyface 
when you spend weeks planning a wonderful surprise for someone and yet they’re so selfish to spoil it for themselves 
so far i’ve established that none of you can be trusted to go into battle for me 
as if i weren’t already cross over brexit. this is too far #takesthebiscuit …

classic west ham 
some people really have no consideration for my dreams and just have to make fun of me we all love the same idol therefore shut up if you hate me. it's not my problem it's yours. so don't have a go at me and then tell me i'm being meladramaic #sorrynotsorry 
congress members on both sides should donate the salaries they continue receiving during the #shutdown2018 to federal workers that are now unable to work. just because they can’t follow through on their own jobs doesn’t mean others that rely on their paychecks don’t. 
@ bandq no delivery on 3rd attempt - customer services no call back twice! someone must be able to resolve this!!! 
get home from #kfc and they didn’t give me my popcorn chicken i ordered. 
so on the first #pokemongocommunityday i have my first bust up. while waiting for a few more to arrive at a raid. a small group turned up and started by the time i realised what was going on it was too late so i missed out. #selfish so much for community!! 
honestly do cunts a good turn and it gets flung in your face! no doing anything for anybody seems the way forward! 
giving up, 30 mins of my life i won't get back 
wtf even is dancing on ice right now lemar tripped and still and stayed in? #dancingonice 
when @ obese_reece is told that @ harry_styles is linked with being 007 @ 
i just loved schwarz, remember being that he left. obviously bergkamp and platt softened the blow... 
@ windows when will my #windows10 taskbar start working again, i have tried everything i can find and it still does not work 
when your wedding dieting and your fella eats a crisp sandwhich and a bag of crisps on the side. tubby prick. 
ffs @ netflix! re. 'the open house'.what was that all about then? so disappointed! to save everyone wasting time: dad dies, mom & son move to new house where weird stuff happens for no reason, everyone gets killed, the end. no really. the end. no explanations, nada. 
tip to people on #saswhodareswins #dontlie 
so proud of @ steph_waring on @ dancingonice tonight. gutted that she went home tonight. 
never using @ uber again! twice in the last couple of months i’ve had my account hacked and rinsed of hundreds! 
@ 
@ dancingonice @ torvillanddean what a joke!! lemar almost fell and you save him. poor @ steph_waring you have been really unfairly robbed #dancingonice 
so @ brookelvincent did amazing skating on her own and gets a low score yet @ donnaair got carried around and got a high score!!! @ dancingonice something not right 
@ matalanhelp disgusted to find out today that my elderly mother who shops at your st helens store every week has been hit with an £85 parking fine for parking in your car park last week whilst shopping in store 
leeds was awesome yesterday - until i had to buy a discounted 2 hour ticket back to london worth at least £70. that is hideously outrageous 
not good when you prepay for ski bag @ neilsonholidays only to be told finally when arrive at @ ema_airport that they are still in spain. 18 bags taken off due to overweight #prepaid pray they turn up as got a lot to loose if don't 
why are tea bags sold in either 80’s or 160’s? probably more bully boy tactics from #macron & the rest of the eu! #upyoursdelores ! 
and there's another disconnection - this one drops us out of a podium finish. the race finishes as it starts ... as an absolute farce #iracingdaytona24 
not really not, they work pretty well, look at our attemps, but, we don't have balls to do the gerrard gozalo, rush in avery attack, we need some self control here, calm but sharp, 
if only we had a little brazilian magician 
that’s it im done with @ itvcorrie 
wtaf!?????? #coachtrip 
@ brendan_sheerin i'm not even joking... you took the new guys break dancing? @ coachtrip 
when someone’s hit your car and you only just notice, fucking fantastic 
@ arsenal fuck sake??! another one of our best players we have let go to a premier league rival?! when will we draw the line? #wengerout #hadenough 
apparently its mkhitaryan dream of playing for @ arsenal wat a load of shite @ arsenal are a fucking shambles changes nothing #wengergottago 
omg ffs, announce fellaini contract extension, its been 48 hours... 
have concluded that fifa 18 is just pure evil and having just seen how much money has been spent on there by my kids in their frenzied, uncontrolled over-enthusiasm - i now want to find someone and start a very large fight... 
so thanks to @ chilternrailway new policy on taking #bikes on their trains, i will now have to drive in to oxford pretty much every shift. great job saving the environment!

we were told yesterday we need to be out of our gym @5 today so they can set up for family night. it’s a snowy/slushy, no outside play day. as we were heading into the gym to burn off energy, we found out they started setting up before 3:30... without checking with us. 
the sort of brainchild thinking this country is famous for. m25 closed at j2 bad enough. long diversion round dartford. get back on at j1a, and one of the tunnels is closed, and so at the moment is the other one 
so yeah, thank you! thanks for ruining mine and my boyfriend's night, denying our chance to see you when we may not be in the situation to again because of a bag containing your merchandise, and for shorting us £90 for fuck all. #theresurrectiontour 
doctor foster won over game of thrones in the nta’s?!!! #ntas2018 
wow! i wish these people were a dying breed. foul, gormless, no brain, uneducated wastes on society! i pray they don’t have kids!!! i wonder if they know in india they have a large christian community... where do they ‘belong’? what country? 
not surprising i’ve seen tons of bad reviews since i had my problem yesterday. my parcel has completely vanished so i’m just out of pocket 
how did @ gameofthrones not win the @ officialntas #gameofthrones #besttv

can’t believe what i’ve just heard on the radio 
thanks to @ sw_help poor running of a network, making me miss my connection. sitting in clapham for an hour was exactly how i wanted to spend my evening. 
i’m just giving up on my samsung galaxy s6 now useless piece of shit won’t charge last time i spend over 500 on a phone @ samsungmobile

seriously wtf jibran. first of all a completely over the top reaction...yet he has offered a humble apology...and you guys still continue to bash him? ffs i thought u were better than the fake liberal brigade paid by ns to bash judiciary! #getoverit 
i bloody did it with a 20 last week!!! #gutted 
@ highpeakbc what are the limitations of a bin man?, our bin was 4 strides up our path to protect it from blowing over in the high winds and it didn't get emptied. #binlorry #derbyshire #idle

. @ cineworld why have i got to the cinema to be informed that you have cancelled my membership for the third time this year? you have my money so now give me my service #disgracefulcustomerservice 
damian, do you know if any individuals &/or orgs are challenging this directly? especially in light of autism & adhd diagnoses being up for ‘interesting debate’. some involved are questioning their existence. 
and this i why i don’t get trains. absolute mayhem at #cannonstreet - everyone having to wait around the timetables as most trains delayed and swapping platforms @ se_railway train running so slow and now 20/25 mins late. what a joke our trains are. and so bloody expensive 
absolutely disgusted at @ ticketmaster ! £12 'service' charge per ticket and £3 'delivery' to print them at home. what a scam! @ southwest4 
mate i’d rather have a mickey mouse badge that the shite they’ve designed! #lufc 
@ zara @ zara_care your returns policy needs to be better and your store's customer service too #wontbeback #nohelpwhatsoever 
who were the 10,000 fuckwits who voted for that shite badge ? they should have given a questionnaire to the fans at er on a matchday and taken it from there. 30,000 + can't be wrong @ lufc 
@ mango so disappointed and unhappy!!!! my gorgeous new @ mango bag has destroyed my new zara coat. black dye everywhere 
i was watching tv one minute then waking up the next, i had just made a cuppa as well haha x 
.......yeah, yeah, thanks for the message am!

@ natwest_help i have had a text tonight saying a £1.00 transaction was declined but a £1299.96 transaction wasn’t the £1.00 was for a hotel i have booked in new york, if i can’t get that hotel now or it cost me more to book it you guys can bloody pay he extra 
what’s the chances the boys are gonna be up for eviction? the girls are gonna pick on the men and it’s a triple eviction! gonna be all women left! it’s wrong there shouldn’t be no power of nominations, it’s gonna be a fix for the women to get through to the final! #cbb 
just earned yourself a chinese burn for that on sat db 
@ therac_uk the company that still takes your money, even though you cancelled your account months ago! #givememymoneybackplease 
not happy that i paid £25 @ specsavers for an eye test as well as buying 2 new pairs and arrived home to a free eye test voucher from them waiting for me 
to the dickhead that just crashed his car into my garden wall before running off leaving it wedged into the wall, cheers you bellend 
same here was watching friends then boom it went down 
@ conservatives absolutely disgraceful, put immigrants first. nhs on its knees, but hell bound on sending money abroad. london is run by immigrants. as long as there allright sod every one else 
2 days on the trot an old man has squeezed his arse in between me and the spare seat and another person at the back, on the bottom of the bus. just no. sit backwards like i normal person, i don’t want to touch you let alone not get into my own pockets 
@ threeuk twice you’ve tried robbing me this year!!! twice to many times!!! thes 2 contracts are my last after 12 years with you 
just took my son to the park and we've both come home covered in dog poo. 
woman at the petrol station thought i was joking when i came to pay for petrol because she thought i was too young... 
that goes for that tit bowley as well 
hmmm someone's not telling the truth! 
@ salisburyreds what was the reason for the r1 driving past 4 people waiting at the bus stop by the old argos for the 10:45pm bus 
when someone tries to sabo your stagey friday

i'm sorry. daniel is ok but how on earth has he beaten jonny and andrew?? ridiculous! #cbb x 
2 pieces greedy sod! 
year of the woman and equality and @ ashleyljames offends the whole of the north of england with her insulting, uneducated, idiotic comment #cbb 
@ danksy1505 how very dare you question @ danmousley40 allegiance to all things lion rampant? we're gonna fall out! #fuming!! 
i’ve never wanted to strangle someone through the phone more than i do right now. it’s called corporate; listen to the bosses and do your damn job. your whining is not my problem! 
fucking bollocky bollocky cuntflaps. just seen who went home first from @ rupaulsdragrace last night.... 
wish i was allowed to give verbal to the kids who have been bullying my daughter. they’d never do it again that’s for sure #hatebullies #noneedforit

@ playstation is fucking wank! gone to go on it 3 times this week after work, and every bastard time it’s been down! pointless having a ps4!! might aswell buy an xbox instead #psndown 
@ talktalk not happy that you've cancelled my home move without even consulting me on it dispute the fact i went through the details of what was happening with the advisor at the time have just had to call up and go through the whole process again 
@ skyuk why was i able to watch game of thrones on box set at 10pm last night but when i go back this morning it’s disappeared?! 
#disabilities #disabilityrights #ignorethedisabledpersonitstoodifficult … 
okay so the #charmedreboot is abit ridiculous.. the cult classic is one of my all time favourite shows and holds so much love in my heart. re doing the show now i can understand but don’t call it charmed. re name and re do like all old classics. 
when you are still sitting outside anfield waiting for @ leahcoathup to finish work and all you want to do is get as far away from the place as possible #disappointed 
when you’re own husband calls you boring #wow 
i even had a cheeky f£#%er come up to me in the last period to tell me to drum more. i’d only taken over from @ kaj354 for a couple of mins after getting no shouts to his drumming earlier. 1st time drumming since the “olden days” 
liverpool could have bought a brand new back 4, but tactically they are so easy to counter attack against and constantly concede goals from counter attacks and set pieces #noplanb 
just not good enough! shambles at the back yet again, migs can fuck off now!!! 
it was all about the fab4, phil was the only player who could unlock a defence. keeper, defence bar vvd and midfield which is 1 paced has not been addressed by klopp. has a great cv, but he needs a trophy can't go on past glories! 
why mignolet? why not ward? why no new keeper? why moreno? why not robertson? why gini? he’s been poor.. can captain? he wants to leave us.. where’s sturridge? who’s replacing coutinho? why no signings since vvd? where’s the 145m gone? #lfc #lfcwba #klopp 
@ dominos_uk your eccles branch has possibly the worst service ever known, from anywhere i’ve ever been to. over an hour waiting, the app shows delivered, whilst the staff laugh at @ vickys86 down the phone. 3 small kids, gone 9pm, no dinner 
takes the fun out of it. imagine scoring a last minute winner n then gets ruled out for var 4mins later! 
west brom have scored 4 with 4 shots. at anfield. in the 1st half. but yeah - our keepers are ok. fucking crap that #lfc 
given up with #watfordfc for now. no longer paying my hard earnt money until a few of those wankers are out of the club! today was the straw that broke the camels back and wasn’t the watford i’ve known and supported since ‘85. 
infuriating driving over an hour to a game only to find out 5 mins before kick off its called off 
i the words of @ barrystantongb #wba 
me in my fave baby gap t shirt when @ krisholt94 scored today...for @ runcornlinnets against @ afcdarwen1 . 
when @ vodafoneuk delete you’re entire spotify of 2500+ songs right before an 8hr flight - good one idiots 
yeah hoping i don't have to introduce myself with a glasgow kiss . some people just no consideration for others 
got pulled over. police asked me why i wasn’t using my indicators. i said “coz it’s no one else’s fucking business where i’m goin” 
@ unitedcarpets who do i speake to about a carpit that's been down just over a month and it's lifting ever were 
shopping in @ tkmaxx_uk today & have been charged twice for my item 
i love where i live but at the same time despise some of the people who live in hull. who in their right mind would deface a bansky, not even being up 72 hours #banksy 
so this is why i will never get anything sent to my home address again! @ vistaprint @ 
that's another programme i will be boycotting for choosing my favourite to leave the show!! #perri 
heard the athletes competing in the world darts championship aren’t allowed to walk out with beautiful women anymore. fuming! #darts 
still think @ brookelvincent was undermarked for her skate!!!!!! @ dancingonice @ itv 
what a complete joke @ mcdonaldsuk is. almost poison my daughter as you obviously can’t read my order. and then your “manager” was a total and utter waste of space. the fact your a worldwide global brand but forget the important things of care and polite staff. 
never been this upset after a win before. can't believe in this day teams can be allowed to kick another off the park like that 
#notgoodenough! went to @ cerealkilleruk cafe for a late lunch, 3:15 approx, at which point they informed me they would only be serving from the “breakfast” menu! i’m sorry but that’s just not on! 
absolutely bullshit 
had one a while back from the kings rd, clipping his nails in the back, he didn’t get his change until he picked them all up... 
after it took them nearly a month and a 100 phonecalls to fix our toilet last year (that was broken from day one) i have no faith that we’ll have hot water or heating again for at least another 3 weeks 
ask @ fayerid to bring us snacks for sunday chills and the selfish bastard struts in with nout but stuff for herself 
#virgintrains literally what is the point in quiet coaches when people aren’t quiet and are so rude to you when you explain to them they need to be quiet? 
seeing a ‘40 years of rumours’ tour to realise its a tribute 
can chelsea and dorthmond stop disturbing me and stop penny pinching around. let these german machines take the money i've given them and sign a replacement!!. i'm sick to death of this!! 
i fecking forgot ... too busy watching #bbc4 #trophy ... they just murdered an elephant :-( @ mondaymusicquiz … 
on a serious note what the actual fuck! how on earth did i lose that 3.0 this game seriously pisses me off but yet i can’t stop playing it 
#cbbann states that she doesn't judge people, yet she actively voted against certain people's human and equal rights, according to the judgement of her religious beliefs. care to explain, ann?

20 years later and we still can't bloody sign tim cahill! #cpfc 
netflix needs to stop putting half a series on of programs 
the 08 leaves at 07leaving a dozen commuters arms waving on the platform.’it was a mistake’ dispatcher says. how hard to see the time? #greateranglia second time it’s happened to me. 
can’t get on bbc iplayer in thailand so i can’t watch draw 
the 18.34 train from brunswick that left early as i ran to the platform... shouldn't be allowed. if it says 18.34 and there's a clock on the platform the guards should watch it and stop making up schedules. #ludicrous 
harsh but i think we the fans are also part of the problem, we accept ashley and just let it happen - fucking wake up your club needs you to act now #driveashleyout #getsomeballs #rafaneedsus 
@ officialplt fully not happy paid for next day delivery for my parcel not to be delivered & he told it would come tomorrow! what a joke what’s the point in paying for next day delivery when it don’t even come? lmao 
train delayed (again) and 3 of your staff were so rude and careless when i asked for an alternative route “i only know this is the train i have to get on” is not an answer! get it together southern 
had a message saying u tried ti deliver a parcel today and nobody was in!! there was some one in all day waiting for the parcel, and there was no sorry we missed you card in letterbox! so ur yodel driver is a liar!#fuming#uselesslyingdriver @ yodelonline 
thank christ another person sees sense!! 
can’t believe i sacrificed seeing my 1 year old twins and 3 year old son to watch that garbage tonight, the players should be ashamed of themselves, a day and night i’ll never get back with my kids #nffc 
haha just found this @ xxbubblebutt @ laurenwright19_ "i have your registration, get my friend home ok!!" 
didn’t take the touts very long. #asone @ 
i am disgusted with the way bbc treated @ brendancole. he is an amazing dancer, strictly come dancing will not be the same without him. watch your back anton #bringbackbrendan 
no need to publish my kids names.. ages.. and place of education... i see a major breech in data protection going on here 
#westham signing absolutely nobody ! every player we’ve been linked with has signed somewhere else ! leave our club or behave as a would be topclub !!! #whufc 
as an fsg neutral it’s a very hard time for me right now. #needtovent #lfc 
please sign mahrez. the meltdown will be incredible 
sat waiting for a smart electric metre to be fitted shud of been here early afternoon 1pm hurry up 
well of course you didn't know, only a few people did. i'm open about it now because i want to stop others from feeling that hopeless. apparently, following you makes me a gang member though #fuming! #hesabitofadick (it will trend)! xx 
someone in the office has been at my desk while i was at the clinic yesterday and god knows what they were up to but german rimjob compilation is in the google search bar thing. 
£50 quid for a jumper to get ruined with harpers nappy cream!!!! all coz she can’t sit still favourite one aswell 
@ dpd_uk you have sent a message to say you have delivered to a neighbour but you haven't. and you've taken a pic of a house which isn't on our street? and we have no number 32. 
why thank him? in your eyes he's done nothing but cause problems. him and anton are the only original dancers from the begining. if you had any respect for brendan you wouldn't have dropped him so you can revamp the show with young ones! 
poor sportsmanship … 
and again this morning, is it too much to ask for a bit of notice before getting on the motorway #lateforworkagain #fuckinguslesstwats @ medway_council @ kenthighways 
my seats were unavailable. i've bought new ones but they are not as good and i couldn't use my ticketmaster voucher which was a xmas present. #shambles 
@ officialplt charged me for free next day delivery. seriously @ officialplt #nothappy #sortitout 
painful to watch and frustrating! fair play to spurs. again we struggle in a big game. shocking passing and defending. #mufc #mutv 
binge watched 3 eps of #kiri last night.excited for the ending tonight!!disappointed is an understatement what is that ending? #kiri #why? 
spent 4 hours thinking it was going to have a great ending.. 
so disappointed in that ending.... predictable and the whole series seemed to be for nothing. 4 hours i won’t get back! #kiri 
i’m sorry but that was truly awful! no person should be treated like that guy was treated by that ungrateful cow! on tv or not!! #unreasonablebehaviour 
@ dttb hope you got your money back for that one worstbrideever … 
how can kiri end like that? 
sarah lancashire....what a woman but what a shit ending! #kiri 
please don’t say it’s going to end with out us finding out who killed #kiri so #annoying 
#cringe no strategy … 
@ chelseafc @ hazardeden10 feel free to send me my £164 in the post lads. 
since ayew signed we've gone from 17th to 19th...shocking signing #swans 
ugh i wanted some ben and jerry’s 
that’s his man management for you! what would you do as a player if he’d done that to you? 
that should say pushing. i'm typing with smoke coming off the keyboard 
@ wembleystadium i’m disgusted. they’ve been made to stand and watch the game. first time for my little one and obviously not a good experience. #badcustomerservice 
richest club in the world and we’re still using smalling and jones as our main 2 defenders 
rio looks how i feel. 
f**king joke of a game. lost by 2 goals but very questionable umpiring and even more questionable scoring, including having 3 goals taken off us at one point #netball 
when you get home from work to find your traitorous family have ordered a chinese without you 
@ ask_dp someone please explain next day delivery to dp? pretty sure next day means next day not the day after? #con #dontreplytodms 
@ tesco is legit taking the piss. paid £6 for delivery between 8-9pm and i'm still fucking waiting. and because my house is so screwed up, i'm having to sit here with the door open in case i miss the knock. it's fucking freezing. #fuming. 
can i just say how sad it makes me that @ 10_kingy is not an @ lcfc player now...... and that i won’t see him drive by my house most days! #lcfc 
@ kcomstadium cannot believe i am stood in the biggest queue i have ever seen at kick off time. thursday night early kickoffs are a joke #getaproperentrysystem #missingkickoff @ hullfcfaithful @ hullfcofficial 
what an absolute joke of a company @ threeuk are, they took £780 out my bank that they said wasn’t being taken out. to then be told i’d wait 5 days for it to be put back in and then to be told to day that it was put on hold and would take a further 5 days . 
i’m in and i have my wristband, but i’ve already lost my ticket. wtf is wrong with me. 
best.part of 3 hours getting home for a 35 mile trip. #notahappybunny 
thanks for the offer of £30 that’s well worth my 8hours 20minutes leave wasted! then told it will take 72 hours for a call back 
so @ dpd_uk cannot find my house so don’t bother to actually tell me, even when i ring to find out what’s happening and get the standard i’ll call you back, still waiting for that call... customer service is on point... i think not. 
hull away, friday nite, on sky and they dont do concession tickets so ive got to pay £24 for my 7 yr old son. da wat... robbing cunts #sufc

very disappointed with @ id_mobile_uk tried repeatedly to upgrade to sim only, and now have been recharged on my old contract!!! 
4 changes needed at half-time @ everton : get mangala off, stick @ waynerooney @ cenktosun_ @ paul_gascoigne8 on & sack big sam. no sane reason for changing a winning team so much. not impressed. if you want to change things for the worse so much then warn fans not to watch! 
what's the point in being able to play the guitar if you can't sing.

i’m sorry, forget lovrens fuckup. all i see is kane offside, failed attempted clearance, which kane never bothered to get onside for, and everyone thinks it’s onside. football gone mad for me. 
still can’t understand how the @ dancingonice judges can justify 19 for @ brookelvincent clearly better than lemar and cheryl & anthony! #ridiculous 
proper cunts the lot of them #cheating

#thebulgerkillers just finished watching this documentary, is anyone else fuming that they didn’t touch on venables. i hate the fact as a taxpayer we have to pay for the likes of him to stay undetected to the general public knowing what he has done and shows no remorse!! 
really wish i didn't watch it #bulgerkillers that poor little lad. the fact it was focusing on the killlers feelings and state of mind when that poor little lad had pain like no one should feel let alone a 2 and half year old child! 
looking forward to the next episode lads. how far will the negatron stick the knife in @ scotlandteam i wonder? must do better. @ easyjet any chance of a refund?wooden spoon decider isn’t worth the trip.

@ _chris4collins has lost his head 
conte sets up defensive against the bottom half teams, plays a false 9 every fucking chance he get's. got a 6ft 2 striker on the bench but plays a 5ft 8 hazard instead! enough is enough! play 433 and play attacking football or fuck off!! #stillcontein 
you are not the real kermit. and it shows …

atrocious performance against a very poor team. we got exactly what we deserved. this is becoming embarrassing & stops @one mans jm. we seemed to think by stepping on the pitch we would win. appalling & unacceptable, again! ! newcastle 
real madrid vs psg on wednesday. which is valentine’s day..... why do this?!? like who planned this....

@ subwayuk don't know why they bother giving you options in the porthcawl branch when they add cheese to the meatballs anyway even after saying no twice so now my lactose intolerant son can't eat them! 
bouncers are still twats though, i was kicked out of albert hall on friday for hugging my best friend and he thought i didn’t know her and was just harassing her. 
people are quick to blame jose but when u look at the players we have on the pitch how can you! martials chance goes in its game over. we also don’t release ball quick enough we don’t have runners from midfield or play to roms strengths #fuckedoff 
rowan took the nail varnish off because his nan told him its just for girls don't even like him wearing it either way tbh but don't want him thinking he can't because he's a boy!! he just liked the colour and thinks that red is lucky. 
was having such a good day, enjoying the abu dhabi heat and then mourin... uno what nvm 
shambles. this team lacks any character. look at the stat of conceding first. in the last 31 games where we have conceded first we have won once. and lost 21. despicable, disgraceful, diabolical. don't care that we are 2nd, these players are just not up to scratch. #mufc 
@ mcdonalds advertising your new big mac range - but you never have them available 
fair play to newcastle united , all of there 11 players play with passion and belief , made manchester united look like a 2nd division side 
just opened my door refrigerator and found this box inside. was absolutely delighted until i opened it. why mom why 
so this is my view of @ thisis_progress because i'm barely 5ft and this tall wanker was rude and refused to move. so inconsiderate!!

raging watching #dispatches i haven’t had a decent pay rise since 2012 & yet my vice-chancellor is swanning around travelling first class, has a grace & favour house & a chauffeur driven car. #timeforchange

@ firstmanchester had to wait for 11pm number 8 from shudehill to bolton as 10.30 didn’t arrive. will miss my last bus home from bolton and pay extra for a taxi. 
it’s just something every customer has to put up with i guess. but when taking on new customers they should be advised verbally that should they have to leave as there is no coverage in their new area they have to pay an extortionate amount for the privilege 
real madrid could potentially let me down a lot of money tonight!! fucking shit 
was just then but it's okay now as #holbycity is on tomorrow night instead phew 
more importantly tonight, kfc haven’t given me a spoon for my beans!! 
you can kick my son. just had to do a rcads questionnaire with him and he’s wound me right up #irony 
everyone’s got that one thing that pisses them off so much, it boils your blood so bad.

@ openreachgb supposed to have put a plate over my drive so i can park my van and car. not even a bt customer. even the 0800 phone number is wrong, for bt and not openreach! 
@ verynetwork what's the point in paying for nominated day delivery if you are just going to attempt delivery on a random day, claim i wasn't in and then change the delivery day again? #disappointed 
if you’re gonna get on a train with headphones on at least turn it down so the rest of us can’t hear the shit you’re listening to pls

@ hastingsdirect 20mins on hold i just want to cancel my policy 
i've loved waiting in for @ skyuk today to now be told you aren't coming until 14th march. totally unacceptable and appalling #customerservice - don't worry though, it's not like i have a job or a child or a life of my own... 
you wouldn’t have to accept criticism if you didn’t think that a 0-1 defeat was an acceptable and wanted result. #losers … 
now it's saying the code they've sent me is invalid! #rollingstones 
ok, so it's not just me who hasn't got any 3g/4g today. sort it out, @ ee. 
naffing car parked over my drive again blocking me in, when there are several drives with no cars. #whymine ?

this var is fucking ruining the beautiful game... 
@ hondaukbikes disappointed with my #cb650f 3 years old and twice in two months now has failed to start. was told in jan it was diesel in fuel which it wasn’t, new spark plugs and flushing got it going. today, same problem. 
looks like my car is stuck until the snow melts 
cannot believe @ itvchase @ itv can get away with that! daylight robbery! …

@ asda your bags are shit!! every time i shop with you, your fucking bags break! snow, kids, & food rolling onto the floor into the carpark!! 5p for stress!! may not seem a lot, but it adds up & as @ tesco say “every little helps” (and their bags don’t break) 
go to the effort of getting togged up and go for a run in narnia and strava fails to record properly. 
@ se_railway what’s the point in having service update system that doesn’t even work. just got to the station to be told my train might not be arriving?! #poorservice 
@ leaseplanuk are the worst! never again... #sayonethingdoanother

@ viagogo why have you cancelled my sale of perfectly good tickets to xfactor glasgow and then charged me on top. i also can’t get to speak to anybody about it 
how can estate agents think it’s okay to hold back £433 of my own money, not like i’m a student or anything

when you run out of paint with this much left to do. fml. #painting 
go to hell @ thierryhenry for making me love @ arsenal ... there have been way too many days filled with misery ever since you left the club 
this bloody wind is making something bang on my roof and its pissing me off!! never gonna get to sleep 
i had the same issue with the boys today......i think part of the issue was that i wanted to build a snowman/go sledging/throw snowballs and they were having none of it. #kids 
i would pay top money to see @ salhill6 make an appearance on arsenal fan tv tonight 
i know mate, shocking!! emailed them about it....didn’t even get a reply 
you’ll never experience disappointment and sadness like i have today.. being told you can go home and the office is closing for the rest of the week, to being told you have to stay and come in. 
it's predominantly dependant on what you call a fragment of wood!! i'm not just bitter because i came out as boro too 
i’m not being funny but no one wants to watch a two hour programme about the snow. 
@ easyjet are you going to put me into my hotel as agreed because of my cancelled flight or do i have to get @ ryanair onto it. been on the streets since 10am! #easyjet #useless 
@ mcdonalds wakefield........ feel free not bothering to give me the dips you asked me if i wanted, oh and don’t worry about that plain double, i’ll scrape all the crap off it myself! you seen the weather??? risked my life for this! #beastfromtheast #stormemma 
@ emtrains @ emtrains can’t believe i had to pay to ‘upgrade’ my ticket to get an earlier train due to weather! what have i ‘paid’ for exactly!!!! #thenitwasdelayed #thedoorsdidntwork 
the snow has stopped so much already and now it's preventing me from going on my weekend away 
people are fuming at khlo …

first and last @ deliveroo experience today. what a cock up. the world doesn’t want me to eat today #hangry

@ teamfa only one game letting down the over 2.5 goals! 
i’m extremely disappointed @ benandjerrysuk @ benandjerrys here i am sat eating thru my chocolate fudge brownie ice cream and was depressed to find no brownie pieces whatsoever, couldn’t be more upset 
at this point i'd consider setting up a gofundme page to pay for a hit on the keeper and that prick o'kane..... 
not happy @ rossobianco1878 literally clicked ‘classof92 hat’ as it opened for sales, said it was in my basket then actually paid (couldn’t have got onto paypal any quicker). only to find out that it was no longer available after purchasing it. what’s going on?!!

damn boss we were absolutely crap we just did not turn up, a shocking lacklustre performance #southend #shrimpers

disgusted with @ eon_se_en sending my pensioner parents a ridiculously high estimated bill. kept them on hold for 40 mins (chargeable of course), to then cut them off! can’t even tell them how to read the smart meter - can’t be that smart then eh?

reyt for you chatting jenni up behind my back 
and so the brooke vincent popularity contest continues... #dancingonice 
thank you so much @ stwater - home from a 10hr shift to no water. website is useless, no notifications and times out if you try to report a problem. what are you actually doing to sort this out?

sick to death of cooking healthy nice food for my child, for her poke it round the plate turning her nose up....when all she wants is the processed shit food her father ‘cooks’ her 
that’s exactly what it’s like, disgusting attitude to have towards good people that are down on their luck, could happen to anyone, no reason to be so cruel and cold towards human beings 
why the 'ell do people find a dog then keep it ?! if they want a dog, then go to #rescue centre of @ dogstrust etc etc. how do they know it"s medical, food needs etcetc.

@ npowerhelp really can’t believe just how shocking the customer care is at @ npowerhq no matter how you contact them, you don’t get any help or resolution. another complaint going in, not that it makes a difference! 
when you write out a shopping list and then remember @ aldiuk is closed for 5 days. #cantgoanywhereelse

@ dpd_uk i am totally disgusted with the (so called) service you have provided. on 2 occasions now you have lost yes lost my items and not even an email or call to say what happened. i hat to do all the "running" around!! #poorservice 
@ yodelonline i suggest you get your act together and stop blaming the snow for not delivering. no snow here for 3 days and roads are clear. 
just gave way to someone for them to steal the parking spot i was gonna go in to. 
when a doctor tells you to give it till tuesday & if the steriods stop working and your son finds it difficult to breath to call her back .... for a receptionist to tell you that's not a medical emergency & won't let you leave that message #fuming!!! 
@ kfc_uki you need to teach your merthyr staff how to put drinks in a cup holder. absolutely soaked from the drinks when going through the drive thru!!! while you're there teach them the difference between beans and gravy!!

hi, thanks for the reply. its a new router, my old one worked fine. i get 150mbps on wired connection every time. i've tried every frequency on 5g. but the same, after around 1 hour it's down to 25mb from over 100. support said nothing wrong with router!! 
@ veryhelpers i don't even know where to start with the complaints - over 20 messages, 10 phone calls, incorrect items & faulty items and you still have managed to mess up my refund - call centre/live chat/website have been no help!!! please get in touch! 
@ kfc_uki_help left my coat in yr kirkstall leeds shop. called up to ask if it had been handed in/it’s still on the chair. was told no and no - they’d “just tidied up and saw nothing”. i had to drive all way back to find it still at the table!!! #useless #lies 
@ verynetwork your service has been absolutely appalling. firstly you charge my card twice then on failing to deliver with an array of complete lies the items are being returned which you failed to inform me so now i am out of pocket £200 with none of the stuff i ordered. 
treated my car to a full monty bath & wax today and apparently it’s gonna piss down tonight ffs!!! 
@ bt_uk have quite possibly the worst delivery service i’ve ever known. 2 hours i’ve been on the phone today to sort it out and it’s still not sorted!! 
i don't know who to blame for not having my novel on sale on amazon uk? is amazon at fault or my pod publishers ? either way i am annoyed. how long will it take them to get back to me? the countdown starts now. 
ordererd some shoes online-size 9 uk and they only went and delivered me a size 9 us which is size 8 in uk. 
@ natwest_help trying 2 switch 2 rewards acc since 13th feb. contacted natwest via messaging on app & told phone 01534 282828 for help. now charged £19 by mobile company this no is 55p a min!! and still no account! why no warning about being channel islands number & cost? 
waited 2 hours for a delivery from @ dpd_uk to deliver for our mother’s day promotion for them to suddenly to decide they don’t have the correct address- not the first time this is happened #clueless #worstdeliverycompany 
@ asksageuki after 2hrs support declared the problem ours & to set up a new profile....duly done....still not working could i get a call as a matter of urgency i have payroll to do today latest...24hrs this problem has taken thus far 
thanks @ specsavers in daventry. went to buy 3 pairs of glasses, found the ones i wanted, told to sit in the waiting room. after an hour waiting, i asked how long i would be only to be told, my name wasn’t on their handwritten list so they would add it now. #goneelsewhere 
put mine in at evans halshaw in chester cos it's under warranty to have a nox sensor replaced they still have it 3 days later, fuckin amateurs 
#fuming! @ hmrccustomers acknowledged failure in hmrc systems for 30hr childcare has taken months to resolve. outcome? going to cost me thousands because we apparently didn’t chase them fast enough for an update to their investigation into a failure of their system #shambles. 
irritated beyond belief. how is it even possible to loose your own clothes in your own fucking house??? !!!!! 
remember the good ol' days when #bbcqt would end with a "funny" question? everyone is so fucking angry these days! 
yep. can't even begin to put into words how pissed off i am about this new aluminium smelter. 
sick of being asked “have you not done ......”!!!! 
very has to have the worst customer service ever! spend a fortune and don’t even deliver your parcels either! what a joke! don’t even have decent phone lines either to talk to them! @ verynetwork 
@ amazonuk pls can you explain this email? it’s taken one week for you to dispatch my order even though i paid a whopping £7 delivery. i’m now told it’s delayed because i requested it? balderdash. pls confirm when i will get my delivery & how i get my delivery charge back 
as someone who's only been watching #greysanatomy since the start of the year, how annoyed am i allowed to be at this recent announcement?

@ hmrccustomers i have just received my annual tax summary and it went to my old address even though you have my new address when i check online ? 
@ curryspcworld you need to up your number of staff at customer service! funny how you've plenty of staff on the tills to take people's money and no one on the customer service desk to sort returns. i'm only here to return an item after poor advice anyway. 
not going to the party this evening as lewys is working late he only decides to tell me after i have drowned myself in my expensive perfume. what a fucking waste 
@ sgngas unhappy your contractors have done work in my road. we have called an out of hours gas engineer out as we have no gas no heating no hot water only to be informed that you have switched our gas off and not informed us. will you be paying the call out fee??!

#josemourinho needs to explain this horrific show of shame. if this is the type of football jm got to offer us then he can do one, this is #mufc we don't play for draw against any team. to heck with pragmatic football. we got good enough players to do the job. 
the only player that tried tonight was @ romelulukaku9 #mufc

yup... #currentmood 
@ sportsdirectuk can you tell me why it is acceptable for you to take money twice out of my sons bank for an order and there is no way of contacting you for a refund. or you make it near impossible to phone you. he doesn’t earn a lot and £50 is a lot of money to him

.... onward travel. i booked my ticket ages ago and did not purchase standby. if your communivation with partners is so poor why not simply ask. after all i had checked in leg 1 in zagreb at 6am. why can your partners not check both legs? #airline #stress

today i experienced the feeling of a hand grenade being launched into my inbox. absolutely ruined a really good day 
the trains in this country are an absolute joke! for the price they charge why can they never run on time or actually reach their destination without some early termination. cancelled this morning. delayed tonight. @ southernrailuk sort it out! 
what is up with people who can't do a simple job properly! 
omg ! no offence to this person but for e.g if a 13 year old kid is playing outside and a pedo touches them - is it the kids fault for wanting freedom and going outside ? 
if we’re out in a burger restaurant and you have the audacity to sit there and cut the burger in two half’s and proceed to eat with knife and fork in stead of cramming in your face hole, i will leave and call your dad a pussy as i do so #realtalk

@ zenithsupport zenith damaged my car through the recovery company and can’t be bothered to give me a call back today. how does that work? still no update on my claim either. absolutely ridiculous!!!!! 
giving women 50% of proms commissions just sounds like equality to me ?? the sheer audacity of this white privately educated man telling those who are societally discriminated against how to feel ... now that is patronising and demeaning. 
@ bcceducation still waiting to hear if our daughter has a place for september

seriously rude and i am so glad that the young girl called them out on it! id be #steaming #planningrevenge … 
and just to add because the @ northernassist staff were busy chatting when the train should have gone, i’ve now missed my connection which in turn means i’ve missed my appointment. 
dear lorry driver, for safety as well as courtesy remember to look right before pulling out into incoming traffic. also, that funny little stalk by your steering wheel it lets the car behind you know you're turning left. why not use it before you down your brakes on? 
@ wheelstaxis you should be ashamed of your drivers getting out the car and threatening someone and swearing when they have customers in the car! this guy needs dealing with asap i’m reporting him to the police!!!!!

disgraceful behaviour from @ williamhill tonight. marking my winning bet as lost. had to spend 1 hour on live chat to ‘try’ to resolve the issue. still not sorted. it’s hard enough to win bets against bookies without them trying to defraud you of winning bets

would you believe me if i said i put koscielny to get booked in a bet? 
all in all @ madedotcom’s customer service is a joke. they have no interest in actually helping their customers, just in making money. #boycott #saveyourmoney 
i contacted @ madedotcom about the bedding, waited weeks for a reply, sent them the info they needed and still had no refund or replacement bedding!! #boycott 
fed up with @ hermesparcels and their invisible couriers. two days, two alleged attempted deliveries. at home, off work all day. customer service won't organise to send to a drop off point or different address

@ amazonhelp thanks for taking then cancelling my order! why on earth would you not make it clearer when i inputted my friend’s address in jersey that for some reason it isn’t possible, so their housewarming present for their new home won’t now reach them in time. 
seems to me that the right of penis people to present as they wish and talk about how sorry they are for all the men they were rude to now that they are soft, delicate ladies (don't mention the wife beating), are more important than vagina peoole representation. #peston 
how much more annoying when i come downstairs & find out it wasn’t my neighbour it was my dad

@ bbcsport @ bbcnews @ cmagovuk why have all airlines made it virtually impossible to fly to kiev for ucl final?! tickets are £120 before and £120 after but the week of the final they're £600/700 plus. are they going to do the same for the world cup? capitalism or politics?! 
managed to go 19 years without suffering hay fever and now, 2 days before bristol, 4 days before i’m 20 and 6 days until europe boom hay fever starts 
what's the point in offering a next day delivery service, if it can't be met? some @ ebay_uk sellers really do take the piss, 7 different sellers, 6 dispatched on time and the 1 delivery i specifically requested for tomorrow is not happening, no response from seller. 
@ wdwtoday booked animal kingdom hotel for september only to now be told the pool is under construction. two hours on the phone and no compensation... #disneyservice

@ southwestair it’s completely unacceptable for you to cancel flights day-of like this unapologetically. just send a text message like it’s no big deal. leave a family stranded. and no other flights out today. 
@ newportcouncil what are you doing locking kid's playgrounds? my council tax pays for this, no? you're taking money by false pretences. sort it out you shitbags. 
@ dewsburyrams no heart in this team at all, too many egos who think they too good for club

couldn't give a fuck about martial for those whinging. the fact that no youngster is even on the bench for the final, meaningless game of the season is horrendous. also if young plays on the wing then starts at lb for the cup final, i'll lose my shit. #mufc … 
seriously livid with petsathome. booked for dog clips & anal glands cleared at vet after. refusing to wash until vet checked him. it's 100% anal glands. however they recommended i walk him round the lakes (he swims) before the vet. where's the logic in that?? #petsathome 
@ vetpractitioner livid. booked dogs in to be clipped and see vet to clear anal glands after. not prepared to groom him on advice of your vet nurse before vet sees him but advised i walk him and let him go in the lake! what's the logic in that? #theywantedearlyfinish 
this is why some people aren't allowed to have nice things. they don't appreciate them. #alsonotevertonrelated

as an exhibitor @ suffolkshow can’t believe i can walk out a gate but am not allowed to walk back through it #jobsworthgonad #fuming#tired#disappointed 
turned the telly over because a newsreader started an answer with a redundant "so", only to be met by a senior copper saying "going forward".

@ wix you have got to be kidding me. you make us pay for a domain name and then tell us we need to upgrade to a premium plan just to use it? that is some highway robbery. #angry 
shocking experience @ waitrose high wyc today. all card machines went down and staff left me to wait 10mins to be told no way of fixing it - could i go get cash out by driving 10mins down the road to come back and pay... i’m 9 months pregnant, due on wednesday. ridiculous.

@ southwestair - i would think boarding my family of 4 at b31-34 we would be able to sit together. we didn’t expect an entire plane to be “saving seats”. beyond frustrated this is allowed. all of us separated. 10 yr old daughter in tears as she has to sit by herself. 
when @ marksandspencer send you post flaunting nice espadrilles and they’re already sold out

i had the "muller burger" in the end. unclear on whether it referred to thomas or gerd but the cheese was austrian and the "bratwurst"? lincolnshire sausage 
when you get disconnected from @ hqtrivia mid game and when it reconnects it says you’re late despite you hearing shazza talk!

@ tpexpresstrains need respond to my complaint- if it’s anything like the trains - they’ll cancel it, send a bus instead and then realise there’s no room and leave me stood there 
i have just grafted my ass off in the gym for 1 hour and a half and my fitbits telling me i’ve only done 22 minutes exercise 
when you specifically ask your husband for garlic mayo on your chips...and he just doesn't get it for you #gutted #divorce 
fuming, genuinely fuming with the end of 13 reasons why. #13reasonswhy2 #iwastotallyrootingforthewrongending 
@ barratthomes @ barratt_homes living in the swallowfields estate in hemel hempstead and being messed around with snagging and poor design and build issues. my wife and i work full time with a 9 month old in tow and this place is driving us bonkers #newbuild #hemelhempstead 
once again @ cpwtweets has messed up my upgrade becoming a joke now. 6 years later, still no idea 
massively disappointed with @ ikeauk - paid for and booked a delivery slot for our wardrobe, reconfirmed it with customer services this morning and finally at 5pm today was told it hadn't even been dispatched!! complete wasted day #sortitout #poorservice 
i am a diva. if i do not have the biggest ego in the room you need to excuse yourself and come back with a better attitude. 
shoulda put some dollar on this....saw it a mile off!! 
was on hold to universal credit for nearly an hour and no fucker answered the call, don't see why they have a helpline if no-one answers at all 
so this arrived. @ houseoffraser @ yodelonline this is shocking! #fragile #betternotbebrokeninside 
got an “updated” router from @ virginmedia and had nothing but connection drops, slow speeds and lag since!!! supposed to be 100mb superfast fibre and i struggle to open an attachment on whatsapp let alone netflix and gaming. #ripoff 
never shopping at @ ikeauk again.... awful service and a catalogue of errors. another 60 mike journey for their errors. 
i don't go on twitter much lol only just downloaded the app to see the funny easy jet account to discover it's been suspended 
what am i supposed to do? you’re so quick to keep increasing my bill shame the service doesn’t match the price i’m paying!!! and yes i have tried testing the faults and all the message keeps saying is “we’ll have this fixed in 10 mins, come back then” that was an hour ago 
so @ yorkshirewater seem to think it’s acceptable to have other people’s waste water running into my garden for the last 3 weeks. i’ve now had to go and buy a pump to get rid of some of it while waiting for them to sort it! 
oh hell, lidl are even worse. their customer service center is actually an inexplicable void in time and space. don't get me started on my leafblower saga. #firstworldproblems 
i went to see the rolling stones at roundhay park in 1982. it was billed as their final tour. they are playing this evening by all accounts. i think i've been skanked #rollingstones #satisfactionmyarse

just seen the trailer for #thelegomovie2 and have to say i'm disappointed that they are pushing a feminazi lesbian agenda in this one. girl power was over and done with in the 90s when the spice girls died. and it's a kids film too. 
@ redbubble so annoyed ordered a card for a birthday this friday - never got delivered asked it to be redelivered can’t post first class so won’t be with me till next monday - thursday?? 2 weeks after i ordered it??

thanks psn for not working, i wasn’t looking forward to playing a good rocket league game with my friends. not at all. #psndown 
erm, @johnlewisretail why did i get charged £18 (not including postage) online for a product that you sell £3 cheaper in store! what is that extra £3 paying for????????

@ se_railway you are a joke. passengers for st mary cray are told to leave the 18.05 at bromley south. apparently there was a train following to take us home. wrong! no train for 30 mins. your compensation scheme is a joke and not adequate. 
i have no new emojis

yeah i know it was!! but i paid £9.95 next day delivery & i ordered it on the 1st june & the rest arrived on the 9th. that is not next day delivery as stated when i ordered. you should state 7 days delivery not next day delivery!! #badservice 
i had flames yesterday and they got my order wrong , i just got mcdonald’s and they have got my order wrong too, how hard is it to put the correct food in a bag 
@ thorpepark is this a scam as i tried to sign up, after asking every question under the sun it wouldn’t let me complete so now i’ve shared my information and got nothing in return?? 
that was neither spiritual or deep! just plain muggy! eyal you absolute megan best not pick alex as she doesn’t fancy him she would just be choosing him as a safe bet to get to the final #lovelsland #eyal #annoyed @ ladynadiaessex 
i know it’s a game show but the way eyal pushed his way in wasn’t cool at all ! #loveisiand 
nah as if i have to wait a whole 23 hours to find out who recouples with who #loveisiand

fucking. stop. brexit. 
@ istanbulairport so why a 50 minute delay leaving istanbul london? apparently due to too much traffic in the air. guess what your an airport of course there's traffic in the air and if it's too much then it's your traffic controls fault. #goingtobealateone 
@ metropolitanorg @ geeta_nanda still not heard anything regarding the damage you caused in my home 29th may #stillnocooker #stilldamagedflooring #joke 
shocking service @ unitedutilities the safety of others should come first! don’t say you’re going to call me and then don’t #stillwaiting #promisespromises 
that feeling of pure unadulterated fury when you fail the promotion board by one point #work 
some stupid women keeps having fires in the middle of day, it's not aloud. i had to close my window because the smoke travels, what if my mum had washing out. 
@ searscares after waiting since november to get a kenmore grill lid you sent the wrong color, @ searsholdings @ 7onyoursideny @ bbb #searsstolemymoney

any company that sells “man sized” tissues needs to really rethink there marketing just call them bloody large tissues #patriarchic

#loveisland2018

rt bad parking again! grass starting to wear down with the caravan parking on it @together18t4cg @ manningmr @ 
@ tuiuk absolutely disgusted with the way we have been treated in store after booking a holiday stating numerous times we have to be back on certain day to be told yes you will be then not getting any paper work only to get email stating won’t be back till day later 
@ riverislandhelp love paying for parking and wasting fuel to visit your shop which clearly states open till 8pm yet the girl on door said at 7.30pm no we’re closed 
7 days of a gastro bug. and i’ve not lost 1lb... 
@ loveisland eyal can’t take his own medicine. it’s not so nice being mugged off isn’t it! and really??? alex had to ask eyals permission to talk to meghan??? can’t stand him! #sorrynotsorry #morningafter 
me knowing we're stuck with megan and eyal for god knows how long 
#lovelsland ffs how has tree shagger and blown up doll managed to not be one of the 2 least compatible? i just want them out!

omg i fucking hate eyal and meghan is just as bad #loveisiand #loveisland2018 
eyal trying to convince the boys he would have been “cool” with alex speaking to meghan....no ones convinced #loveisland 
@ hermesparcels have once again blatantly lied about attempting a delivery! status said delivery was attempted at 17:25. well that's a massive lie cos i was in until 17:35! another driver who can't be arsed to do their job and deliver good on time! @ asos_heretohelp 
#eyal, alex does not ‘owe you’ or need to ask your permission before speaking to megan. she does not belong to you! #loveisland 
it’s been cancelled. i was on this flight. you should have received an email. i’ve had to pay £400 ++ for a new flight to london. 
no smoking it says at #wembleystadium!! so why do some tossers think they should ignore it plus the weed #twats 
literally same year, same month but i do you by 16 days always mate x #onetrickpony 
@ klm_uk why did you take my very small bag for gate check when i was at the front of the q, yet let many others bring theirs on causing delays when they couldn’t find space? unfair and poor customer experience. 
@ budget i need contact details for your complaints department asap! your advisor karmina has the worst attitude and i've received a disgusting service from her just now on the phone!!!!

@ bbc been waiting an hour for an iplayer password reset!!!! in the meantime i'm missing the best game of the world cup so far.......... but you enjoy that corporation tax!!!! 
virgin media is fucking shite true story 
christopher chope ought to be ashamed. what's to debate about banning upskirting? why are you basically legitimitising this? why are you saying it's okay? sir chris, mate, i hope you'd feel the same way if someone did it to you. #christopherchope #getoutofparliament 
#christopherchope explanation if you wouldn’t mind .... please i may even flash you my knickers #whosmp 
got nigeria in the sweepstake. all hope now gone because the russians won’t allow the fans to take in their lucky chickens to the games #fix

little shits down my cul de sac have either nicked my 6yr old girls scooter or thrown it over the fence onto the m3 spotty little oik offered me out when i questioned where it had gone. 
sat on a coach and the @ itv app has stopped working 
ended up in the right green side bunker with no sand in it, 3 to get out and thinned into the cabbage behind the green 
@ barclays why can’t someone put cash in my account anymore (in store) when they have all the details ? always allowed it before! how sillly! 
you did not just tweet that!! why should we be careful of what we wear?? imagine it was your daughter who was upskirted (god forbid). would you tell her she was responsible?? #dontbeanass 
up at 4am to watch the boxing, gotta watch the conclusion of the tennis until the live cross!

@ o2 is the single most terrible network i’ve ever been on. full signal and nothing ever loads 
after driving home about the conversation, or lack there of considering the moment i said as #kanyewest biggest fan, i wasn’t going to listen to any of #kanyewest new albums and was met with “his newest album made me cry” and a back turn, all i thought was... 
@ sainsburys went to sainsbury’s to buy a chicken yesterday, when i got home i was absolutely disgusted buy the size of it £5.50 it cost me luckily there is only me and my wife if i still had kids at home it wouldn’t of fed us all 
missed a parcel delivery so my dreaded neighbours signed for it , she only went and opened it , surely that’s illegal 
account deactivated due to ‘community guideline violations’. their stuff always was decent but apparently the prudes at instagram feel male nudity *must* be covered up, because... well... fuck only knows! 
i ordered her something dark and handsome about a month ago i think you must have sent it to laura instead #chaseitup 
oooohhhhhh ... the girls are about to be ! @ loveisland 
so not excited for holiday now i know there’s a tropical storm there atm lol 
i’m missing love island because of this. 
how can @ xs_11official not have 1 shot in 90 minutes, what a joke. he’s so lazy, loses ball and just stands still. #worldcup #brazilvsswitzerland 
@ ihgservice staying at crown plaza felbrigg this evening before a 2.30am start in the morning with my 1 year old daughter and the cleaners think it is appropriate to hoover the corridors at 2035?? thanks very much for waking my daughter

been stuck in traffic jam for 2 hours now #cambridgeisshit 
told martin to put a bet on mexico to win... he didn’t listen and picked germany 
i am sooo deeply over guys sexually harassing me on the daily. if it’s not colleagues at works it’s passerby’s in cars or my oh so lovely neighbours. 
had to use mums phone just to prove it..: no service yet this says 4g but i guess paying £41 per month is ok for you receiving it but i’m paying for nothing! #hatevirgin 
@ richardajkeys want to elaborate on why your current employers have chosen to cut the feed to those who paid for the subscription through @ beinsports connect service? #wasteofmoney #everyworldcupbeinhasissues

@ royalmailhelp @ royalmail when u post 2 cards at the same time and within 1/2 mile of each other but the one with child's name on doesn't get there but the other does cause the chances are a kid gets money sent #thiefontheloose #stealingfromthequeen #lowlifes 
me right now to the producers! how dare they make us wait!! i need to see dr love make his move on kristen bell .. i mean ellie ... #loveisland #dralex #drdomore 
my mum came in a told me we scored for the 2nd time when i was only 10 seconds behind, she basic spoiled the whole game 
she's gonna be with you! 
fed up of people saying ‘watch out for the bikes’ (cycles and motor)! what a load of old s€&@e!! they ride two abreast (cycles) on our country lanes, and motorbikes think they own the bloody road, dangerously overtaking in said lanes and motorways! 
right i’m just going to come out and say it.... that ref has definitely been paid off!!!! this is a joke! #engtun 
@ schofe surely something should be done about the tunisian players holding harry kane down. what ever our boys do is wrong. what happened to fair play. not happy with ref 
@ barkerross where does a member of your staff get the idea from that if i don't find a different 2nd reference by tomorrow i will have my wages withheld? the goverment website says different, pretty disgusting tactics that 
when @ tesco discontinue your favourite sanity snack! macros will never be the same again! 
why is this ref a bias little bastard 
whos pocket is this ref in?!! how can they get away with these bad decisions!?! #sacktheref #engtun 
feel like the tunisian team has too much love for #captainkane because they are constantly fucking hugging him to the ground #engtun is the ref blind #england 
how on earth was that not a penalty #engvstun 
it’s not england vs tunisia it’s england versus the fucking ref. #engvtun 
wow how did you get the footage from the kane challenge so fast!? #sotrue 
#engtun #penalty 
far too hot to sleep #knackered 
scratch what i originally said about alex after watching the whole episode you realise what a dipshit he truly is 
i am absolutely 
i specifically asked the ride operator, “does this swing leave the ground?” he replied “no, guv”. i was blatantly lied to! … 
from a season ticket holder and 3rd generation gunner, you will be greatly missed!!!! good luck with the next move, you were a top class player and should never be leaving the arsenal 
i’m sorry but adam is grinding my gears tonight, he’s fit but has a vile personality and is cocky as fok reminds me of a fair few #twat #likeasmugmug #gameplayer 
how the fuck can we be letting wilshere leave but keep the likes of xhaka and elneny! 
ordered trainers over a month ago didn’t receive them and was told they was no longer in stock to replace them so now i’m waiting for a refund and all @ footasylum can offer is 10% off full priced orders #poorservice 
@ jackwilshere leaving arsenal... wtf!!!! literally fuking gutted!!! should have been given the captains armband not a fuking reduced contract!! 
had a sideboard from @ ikeauk now for 3 weeks & still haven’t been able to put it together!!! 3 attempts & they still can’t deliver the right parts!!!! are they joking?! someone is getting an angry email tomorrow!!!! #ikea 
spent £240 on @ fotc tickets in london, gig got moved. i threw my old tix out. @ viagogo won’t replace - corporate theft!! 
@ hermesparcels i have received these two delivery cards with out any detail except the date and where the courier has left my packages. unfortunately i found nothing in the shed #disappointed #myhermes #unprofessional. no idea where my deliveries are 
they made my skin bleed on about 5 fingers as well! 
@ emtrains why on earth is the last train from stp now 22.20 and not the usual 00.15 people traveling to football matches in london expected to leave early? 5 min walk from my house to wellingborough and i’m going to have to return to nmp 
@ dpd_uk just had a message kyle in dundee tried to deliver, been waiting all day for this parcel and get a message telling me i am not in? he didn't even make an attempt to deliver because i have a buzzer, no card left either and no contact number for local office. 
how are you @ davem316 ? #coat #coatgoat 
anyone else fuming that ellie told wez she just wanted to be friends and then he’s all over laura again@loveisland 
omg my power cut out just as alex was about to kiss ellie #loveisiand 
i have become the guardian of manners and consideration on the tram! absolute disgrace that people didn’t even make way for a blind lady with a guide dog nevermind a lady with a pram. not talking about a seat here just letting people on. #manners 
2 hours to get home from work! they shut the road between coldra and magor ! even worse i knew about the accident and accidentally took wrong turn onto motorway instead of going to newport off tredegar roundabout 
i’ve had a much needed day off work today, yet i still feel a tad drained. 
omg nooo do not phone me when #loveisland is on i'm missing it 
don't tell me i've been missing out on these 
@ bet365 why couldn’t i combine 3 betbuilder bets today to cover the three games? #cameintoo 
ok enough is enough. just because there is a tax on sugar i dont want to be given one option of fucking diet or zero sugar soft drinks! i want full on real sugar in mine not replaced with aspartame and acesulfame.k!! these chronicles are worse for you! #sugartax 
imagine paying hundreds of pounds to get out to the world cup, get a decent seat, you are ready to watch your team, and you sit in front of some prick blowing a vuvuzela for 90 minutes #worldcup18 
it always astounds me baron that people think it’s perfectly acceptable to say what they damn well like about us but if our parents said to their kid, what a funny mark they have on their face, there’d be outrage. 
that’s a liberty thinking you’ve scored whole bench celebrating with you just for it to be taken away from you 
as if uruguay have only won 1-0 against saudi arabia? i'm deleting my skybet account after this world cup 
yet again i am asked to put my hand luggage in the hold and there is absolutely plenty of room. i even attached the picture of the cabin above my seat and all passengers are sat down. thank you for adding an extra 50 minutes to my work journey !! #fuming. 
#arriva is it acceptable for people to have bags on seats on a packed train from chester to birmingham international as i have seen several passengers pay for one seat #disabled 
@ dpd_uk care to explain why my parcel wasn't left as instructed?? 
@ veryhelpers please can someone d.m me? #yodel #deliveryfail 
unfair talk about given the short straw.what a joke! #loveisland 
i’m not a lover of cats and would never hurt one however; the one that keeps shiteing in my front garden is really testing my patience !! x 
mumzy made breadfruit ackee and saltfish but i’m cuttin weight! 
absolutely disgusting. that is why so many women and men are afraid to come forward because nothing is ever done about it. her word against his and vice versa. he will never face his crimes. how many others are walking around free??? #24hoursinpolicecustody 
don’t.... jacks socks are left next to the washing machine

it's not about what you know or how good you are, it's about who you know and how much you brown nose. #irritated #politics 
this bullshit wind has caused something to fall off my windowsill and smash all over the floor for two days in a row now 
it’s a bit pointless considering the dress was wanted for tomorrow. next day delivery was paid for and as usual dp failed to deliver on time and failed to reply to tweets 
i just love the tiny little cloud hanging over your head. like something out of a cartoon 
@ yodelonline i’ve waited all day for item to arrive just tracked it again says driver was here half an hour ago can’t find property and to reschedule but item needed by my aunt today for a surprise party this weekend

@ virginmedia apart from your appalling handling of my late father’s account, you have the downright insensitivity to wait just a short period before sending this!!!! you’re as bad as ever, which is why you lost my account too! 
@ jodijaben driving little one to gymnastics & some moron in a 4x4 throws something at her through the window. she's ok but seriously how mornic do you have to be to do that to a mum and child-f****ing idiots. @ derbyshirerpu keep an eye out around oakerthorpe area please.

when your contract should have changed to a sim only at the end of may and they send your bill for full amount useless @ threeuksupport @ threeuk 
@ itvnews absolutely shocking representation of the initial incident commander at #grenfelltowerfire on your early evening news programme. you should be ashamed 
having to try and make my eyebrows look half decent and do my own nails for the summer ball because the beautician didn’t show up for my appointment 
obviously cancelled! @ gwrhelp is such a fail!!! #theworst over pricing tickets, and cancelling or delaying trains all the freaking times 
right. it’s official. there is no suitable picture out there for my front cover. #ifonlyicoulddraw

when you go to place a bet with @ skybet for £1000 return and the app messes up and doesn't place it. then your team scores and the bet would have come in #saudiarabia 
egypt, morocco and tunisia are a monumental waste of africa's spots at the #worldcup. as bad as ghana is, they would have done better than these clowns. #ksaegy 
some inconsiderate so & so at the back of me was mowing his grass at 9.15 last night i have a 5 year old & a 9 month old 
i’m having a terrible monday thanks to you. on the hottest day of the year your “greenhouse” i bought about a month ago decided to give way and topple over throwing all my months of hard work onto the ground. i’ve now spent 2 hours trying to save what i can of my plants. 
@ petermoorelfc queued in the acs ticket sales for an hour, got all tickets sorted only to be told my card did not qualify even though i’ve been every cup game for years - any ideas??? 
when @ tescobankhelp charge you a £12 late fee and remove the interest free from your credit card because they failed to take a direct debit out on 10th june which my bank confirmed was set up on 31st may! 
@ parcelforce can you please tell me where my @ picture_frames parcel is, as i’ve had these two texts off you. no card has been put through my door and i’ve rearranged my day to be here between 12-1pm as you said that when it would be here!!!!! 
train abruptly stopped but a man actually fell on me breaking my nail in the process no apology #london #commute #tfl 
so, i managed to avoid getting covered in beer at the pub during all the goals but, at half time someone knocked my own pint all over me 
why do so many churches think they are so good but when it comes to looking after people that need there help feel it's ok to turn them away. not religious it's treat everyone for who the are. 
someone please explain how i’ve got a cold in 30+ degree heat 
poor laura. her tears speak for everyone broken hearted girl ever. megan can get out, wes can get out, adam and samira can get out and zara can get out!! #loveisland 
can not believe wes has jumped ship so quickly .. men seriously just follow their dick. and everyone egging megan on are dickheads she’s just after the ‘stallion’ to get more airtime cause she got no personality. #getmeganout #loveisland #snakes 
parachuting into the villa to end wes. #loveisland 
i would be less annoyed if my own husband was cheating on me.. what a pair of cunts!!! @ loveisland #loveisiand 
what a vile person she is! she will mark him as number 21 and drop him like a sack of shit on the outside world! #lovelsland #teamlaura 
literally megan is the worst girl ever. as soon as a girl says they don't have girl mates you know they are a dick! and megan mate you'll never have a girl mate after that well maybe zara since she finds it's so funny #loveisland 
wes is lucky how she handled that... my drink would be perfectly shared over both those bitches #loveisland 
i just can’t even cope.. wes, megan.. an absolute pair of dickheads!! i feel like it’s a set up!! #harsh #loveisland 
if i was laura, megan would be head first in the hot tub with my foot up her arse and wes would be next!! the smirking irked me #noclassjustcrass #loveisland 
the fact that she smirked 
i’m over #loveisland. i’m done watching it. every. single. couple has been a disgrace and every person’s snakey in some way except dani and jack, but i just can’t deal with this year’s lot 
@ loveisland wes what a snake, i liked u and liked megan but what a couple of snakey pricks u are #teamlaura 
well looks like i’ll be booking my flights in the morning then #wesuwanker 
if i was laura i would have dragged megan around the garden by her horrible little head.. #loveisland 
feel it needs more actually. i was 
if you google - you will find some absolutely lovely videos/images of megan doing all sorts on camera for money..... thought you were shy hun???? #loveisland #rat #snake 
confused... megan is a ‘feminist’ yet uses “she’s slept with more guys than me” to justify herself... she’s calling you a slag because you begged the guy she’s coupled with to kiss you and then smirked while he ditched her. you’re a mug @ loveisland 
al i am livid!! ive seen right through her from the day she came in! slyyyy!! i wouldn’t trust her to be left alone with me dog!! 
hate spiders, 1 just rushed towards me like an attack or maybe he/she thought my locs was a bunch of his friends. i had only the settee cusion to defend myself & he/she escaped. how am i supposed to sleep now? 
@ itvhub paid for plus, used my data abroad to download programmes now it’s saying i have nothing downloaded 
@ vodafoneireland @ samsungmobile can someone tell me why the latest update on my s7 has auto-downloaded facebook app??? even though i'm not on fb & haven't been for 7 yrs!! it won't let me uninstall & is wasting space & battery w/updates etc!!! #itstoohotforthisshite 
absolutely fuming!! ask the public to vote and then get the islanders to decide on who goes!! #loveisland 
once eyal was dumped didn't the boys think ellie would have been a good choice to go too?! budding romance?!?! who's ellie got a budding romance with if eyal has gone?!?! #loveisand #bringbackzara 
grrr @ amazonuk driver, i really needed those trade shorts for this hot weather! can’t be bothered to finish ur route, went home instead? no attempt to call or follow instructions. ‘attempted to deliver’ my arse! inconsiderate, unprofessional. gig economy is working..?! 
gone to book flights with @ ryanair and the price is different for the exact same flight on the exact same date and time on 2 different web pages at the exact time. how can this be? #muggy #fraud #headofficecomplaint 
ellie should’ve gone not zara! 
@ loveisland you should have let the viewers decide. #noton 
anybody who thinks what wes or megan did was okay.. we can’t be friends. #notokay have a little decency. @ loveisland 
@ virginmedia do you teach your staff to hang up on customers when they’ve spent 30 mins trying to sort out a non-working box? #missedloveisland #notmytypeonpaper 
i can’t believe a tv programme can get so many women raging!! bloody megan & wes #loveisland 
no justification of getting rid of zara! “we’re keeping the girls with budding relationships”..what! megan who’s just been a complete snake & been with wes 24 hours & ellie because of what? she has no relationship with anyone, the guy she did has just left! 
megan should have gone #okbye 
wtf boys? getting rid of zara you mugs. should have been ellie. #loveisiand 
i have no idea whats going on, on this tv programme but can hear @ sam_1015 
wrong decisions all round #loveisland 
megan should be the one leaving !! #loveisland 
why have they just split up 2 couples !! #loveisland 
omg are you for real? megan should have gone with eyal! #snakes #loveisland 
thanks gdpr. now i can’t read lots of us websites. isolation from foreign news. n korea lite. really. bloody. clever. 
@ skybet 1 game doing ur bet for 50-1 no 0-0 draws in group games should surly be paid as a winner for loyal customers! especially after the bastard were a complete fix! #paythebetout #shocking! 
i bet zara is feeling like a right mug after her exit statement and watching adam tonight #karmaisreal 
lost two tenners today in town. i hope the pot head that found it loved every second of their joints #bastards #widnes 
when kfc runs out of wingz 
yup! she’s a nasty woman! last time i corrected her she blocked me. no compassion. humanity died many pieces. 
i have to wait for them reply to me before i can escalate 
ffs england, going to most likely miss the last 16 game because you didn’t try to win!! #worldcup 
@ loveisland not starting until 21:15? #fuming! #howrude #wheredoisendmycomplaint 
ahhh they were so nice bet you are too @ cannyfood - do you still have a stockpile? 
it's all well and good not going for the win (it isn't ok) but we don't look world class, we look ordinary. we could have had a psychological advantage! #engbel 
what’s the point in paying for next day delivery and it not turning up... it’s because @ hermesparcels take the mick, so now i’m £5.99 down and no clothes for my holiday tomorrow... #great #rant 
not a single man u fan in the pub got excited when marcus rashford got put through. he does this every weekend. #worldcup 
@ dominos_uk you have ruined my life. this pizza was the worst i have ever had, i don't even want to watch the rest of england going to my bed to sulk! look at this shit! burnt, bland and bollox. 
the only man in the country that’s not watching there national team because i’m stuck in bham new street station hope the counting place get blow up 
once again my box is cracking & not receiving signal @ skyhelpteam but i cant stream a service i pay for from my phone to my tv because "outputs are blocked" absolute joke of a company. #greatcustomerservice #ifonlytowatchthefootball 
so @ ryanair thought it was acceptable to cancel my return flight from marseille. no other flights available. so a refund. can you imagine the cost and hassle to find a return flight at such short notice. outrageous. 
who's bright spark who authorised using @ batman brand to sell known carcinigen to kids? #excuseforbeinglatein4words 
just had a sneaky little email from @ britishgashelp at 23.33pm! my monthly payment to be raised from £90 pm to £266 pm!!! seriously?! what the hell! this is not the first time this has happened - sick of the harassment & pressure. formal complaint. @ ofgem @ spellar mp 
imagine i’m having to trek to get my property back from someone who shouldn’t even have it #fuckinglibity 
@ missguided wore these once an this happens!!!!!

i’m so angry with josh! what is he playing at?! gee is sharing with dani and you’re sharing with a girl! #loveisland 
well tonight ended unexpected early... 
so so true she really is sly she has mugged alex and laura off now … 
still no response from @ virginmedia...also asked to speak to a manager but they were conveniently in a meeting 
how can some areas have a hosepipe ban already? it was pissing down for the first 4 months of the year. maybe the water companies should fix all the leaks 
once again drunken arseholes give away the result to a 7 goal classic! i’m so done #fraarg #worldcup #worksucks

lose $130 at the casino. in 1 hour. start sulking. go home. early. sound. 
@ yodelonline @ missguided ordered something for the weekend payed next day delivery and haven’t received my parcel 
imagine going to @ mcdonaldsuk ordering 3 chicken selects and getting home to find only 2 in the box 
pensioners should be banned fro going anywhere near a supermarket or shop of any kind on a weekend!! they have all week to do stuff but no they want to get in my way on a saturday!! move out of the way doris!! 
landed @ manairport at 13:40 from malaga still not one bag has been put on the carousel #incompetence 
connors going to get smack if he don’t hurry up 
when your sisters @ ikeauk sofa delivery gets delivered to the wrong address and the guy who it has been delivered to has pretended to be her boyfriend #ikea #gettheaddressright 
@ vodafoneuk pestering me for weeks about being due my early upgrade, make effort to go into the store and they tell me it's not due for another 6 weeks #hatevodafone #nothingbuthassle 
so done. genuinely so pissed off with how certain family members treat me. i work my arse off over 50 hours a week, doing split shifts, that take up over 12 hours of my day.. and when i have my 2 days off, im the one chasing them to make plans, and they dont respond. 
was this when arsenal visited great ormond street? hannah was in at the time and i missed them by like 10mins, 
@ burgerking i’m fuming - ordered onion rings and you didn’t give me them. my first ever burger king experience has been tarnished because i thought your chicken burger was quite good 
clearly the producers want georgia to get dumped from the island otherwise they would have shown her the kiss!! #loveisland @ geesteelx 
if @ loveisland comes between jack & dani i will boycott @ danidy 
@ itv2 @ loveisland @ carolineflack1 name of the show: love island. couple in love: jack & danni. producers: #lovelsland #letthembehappy 
@ loveisland i don't think i can take much more of #loveisland georgia being so loyal while josh is being a player, yet love island hides it from georgia, jack and dani are both so so loyal and love island hurts dani and makes her cry thinking bad things about jack 
@ mrddyer needs to kick some producers ass for what they’ve done to dani tonight #loveisland 
disgusting mate and all @ lottie_louisek could do was laugh 
@ loveisland you better fix dani and jack, because that was bullshit! why not show her he’s been camping outside and declaring his love for her!! #bullshit #loveisiand 
fuck off @ itv2 you’ve gone too far now. if jani split up you are losing viewers #loveisland 
the love island producers clearly don’t know the meaning of love if they’re trying to fuck it up like that #loveisiand 
so annoyed with @ loveisland making dani that upset no need for that at all!!!!! 
#pettypeople! 
me after seeing how out of context the message dani got was #loveisland 
@ loveisland is absolutely brutal! how can you honestly do that to dani and jack!? 
@ loveisland why? why show that clip to dani for! shouldn't you be showing georgia what josh is up to instead.. it's supposed to be love island but yet your trying to deliberately f'up a genuine couple. makes no sense. #loveisland 
no! if the producers deliberately break dani & jack up this programme is fucked!! #loveisland 
cafe nero, you are now cancelled. i will forever go to costa. never refuse water to a dog, especially not a guide dog. done #cafenero #cafenero #badcustomerservice 
nothing’s changed on the liverpool sale 13 credits dropping straight to 4! surely it needs to be staggered better than that. knew i’d hit the post with 12 credits. 
wow @ waldron1994 give up now he called u a dafty this haggis munching ,caber throwing, in bru sipping, kilt wearing sweaty sock is a crazy man. 
where’s the wild colonial boy? 
i think everyone is fuming at the moment like #lovelsland 
@ virginmedia literally missed last 10 mins off my recording which means i can't see the end!!!!!!!! #loveisland 
omg was thinking the same what an absolute mug josh is #lovesisland #joshisqmug 
josh is just another example of a tool #loveisland 
megan is actually revolting. she makes me sick. i don’t want her promoting no clothes no flat tummy tea no pallet, not even a fucking pencil! #loveisland 
poor little g.,josh what the fuck you doing mate!! #loveisiand 
georgia dont need that ninja turtle looking melt #lovelsland 
#loveisland #ridic 
watching love island on record so i could skip the breaks, wait to see if josh walks in with someone else. and it had stopped fucking recording right near the end. is this a joke 
how dare they move @ loveisland for the football!! how do they expect me to stay up so late?!?!! 
josh and megan can fuck off!! #loveisland 
my tv stopped recording after the last ad break #loveisland 
can’t fucking stand megan, just because georgia’s well liked she sticks up for josh telling him she gets it. fuck off you bucket cunt the only thing you get is treated for chlamydia every weekend #loveisland 
josh u absolute shitcunt!! georgia stay composed girl you got this #loveisland 
okay josh... you can absolutely choke! men are trash and that’s the tea #loveisland 
to be honest i’m mighty disappointed in you, why have you not commented on the fact that our boys are forced to sing that oppressive and divisive nationalist anthem at the start of each game. corbyn loves football, he would fix this, whose side you on eh? 
i am angry that your last name does not begin with eh. 
did josh just roll his eyes as georgia was walking away?! #loveisland 
when the taxi driver misses the mcds turnoff and you’re left with kfc #dontevenlikeit #chickenfriedwhat 
who gives a shite, your services stopped at 85minutes! luckily our boys didn't let me down like #virginmedia freeview here i come, oh wait i don't have tv or fibre optic that i pay for … 
so scott’s just told me everything that i’ve missed from love island so far 
what's up @ virginmedia ... missed the equalizer and had to go freeview! after finding the aerial cable! no tv no internet! #whospayingmymobiledatabill 
@ loveisland is trying to break dani and jack up on purpose ? it’s called love island for a reason to find love not mess it all up for views #loveisland 
been looking forward to my left over indian from last night all day. come home and my fat shit of a boyfriend has eaten it and even had the balls to eat all my haagen-daz ice cream too 
why are we playing on saturday at 3pm. everyone will be out enjoying the . should be an evening quarter final match #england #worldcup 
i have an exam on the day of the world cup final. 
why is #loveisland only on for 40 minutes? 
why spread this kind of news is it to infuriate people who work and look after their own gardens! i cannot believe the council do this is this what am i paying my council tax for #lazy #getajobandcontribute 
get lost football, i wanna watch love island!!!! 
proper fuming i've gotta wait even longer for #loveisland thanks to the football if i didnt hate football already i hate it even more now. 
i’m not against the football, i don’t mind it at all but today i only got a half an hour lunch break on a 14 hour working day and now love island isn’t on until 10pm all because of football 
in pe bridgette told me that snowboarding wasn’t a sport #socut #unbelievable

fuming @ thameslink - could not get into london from st albans tonight so wasted two return ticket prices, have had to drive in and pay for london car park at the o2...extra £80 spent #nothappy #wasteofmoney #refundplease 
just watched @ motorwaycopsuk for an hour, polish & romanians pinching blokes tools off site & out vans!! even police say it’s out of control but nobody listening as per 
your queen is performing with the muppets at the o2! the day before i’m going 
why have we been thrown off the 18:11 cannon street to dover priory at orpington and told to go to bromley south for services to rochester to faversham, @ se_railway? #delayrepay 
@ devinwenig further email sent, still waiting for the fraudulent activity carried out by your uk staff and the buyer to be rectified! #disgusted!!!! 
nice one when you sprint across victoria station full pelt and the @ gatwickexpress guy just laughs and tells the train to depart. #sweatingoneout 
@ vodafoneuk i really couldn't get any angrier with vodafone if i tried 
@ asdaserviceteam are literally the worst i'd advise anyone to shop elsewhere!!!! 
for reasons that are beyond me the kids school shake up the classes each year (two form entry). for the first time since nursery 9yo will be without his best friend. a big fucking deal for my beautiful autist. 
completely agree steve, imagine a keeper walked into a session late and then just said “thanks for waiting for me” 
likewise!! have just spoken with customer services - in stock on 8th apparently as my pup won’t eat anything else!! 
apparently when i’m drunk i turn into georgia from love island?? that’s a new one 
as soon as i get the chance to meet @ mischiefmngrs my body decides to be ill. why!? 
i’m really hating @ cigna right now. they dropped my fiancé “by accident” just before major surgery. now she’s home & can’t get rx because they still didn’t fix the problem they claimed to have fixed last week. 
why the fuck did he save megan #loveisland 
order a birthday present from @ pandora_uk and as soon as i've paid there is no record of my order!! 
go to order my graduation dress from @ boohoo to find there’s no next day delivery not like i pay a subscription fee for it or the fact that my graduation is a once in a lifetime event #wheresmyrefund 
biggest down side of iphone 7&8 how am i meant to listen to my music and charge my phone

@ vodafoneuk i’ve tried calling about 5 times in the last two weeks to talk about an upgrade but the ivr says due to an emergency to call back later?! 
how can @ wizzair cancel my flight an hour and forty minutes before i’m suppose to fly and then not be able to get me on another flight!!! absolutely ridiculous #wizzair 
@ royalmailhelp came home to find my letter box like this. 
trek across london to visit my mate and her newborn baby and probably gonna miss it because @ se_railway can’t run a railway. been sat outside dartford for ages due to ‘train crew shortages’ #shitservice 
@ sw_help you have no idea what it feels like to be helpless in breathless carraiges!! the idea that there is no ‘fat cat’ ideology is ridiculous, when you pass ‘cattle’ class on south western trains!! #hot #cattleclass #classsystem 
i’ve dropped my phone like 50x and the screen has been fine. so ofcourse i dropped it today and had no fear to turn my phone over and find my screen cracked, unattached and dangling from the back of my phone!! arghhh! whyyy? #justmyluck #typical 
did i just see laura lick wez’s cheating ear!? right, i’ve had it with his show, they’re all the bloody same! #done #waxytounge #loveisland

jack was not forward.. he barely says a sentence a day 
can we send the clip of georgia kissing jack to laura’s phone so everyone can see she did kiss him and tried again !!!! @ loveisland #loveisiand 
ellie calling georgia ugly #loveisland 
loving the way @ southamptoncc bother to take seriously the complaints of barking dogs ruining our summer 
absolutely terrible service from @ hermesparcels . three failed collection attempts this week. the tracker gives the time of attempt which is nothing but fiction! i've been home waiting and no one has been anywhere near. #lies 
some fucker has put songs on the juke box whilst me and @ adamroostan were on the quizzer. that’s not bleedin’ on. jess glynn inbetween proper tunes. have a word, i’m a bastard member. 
i can't remember the last time i got a train on time!!! @ se_railway just a suggestion, but fixing the signalling problems you experience everyday is probably a good idea. then review your staff...& look for some with a brain. 
@ mcdonaldsuk charged for things you’ve not given me!!!!! returning home on a friday to find missing items 
awful service form @ verynetwork gave me a time slot today for my son’s new bed. i waited in and contacted them when the time slot passed. apparently the item is out of stock and i have to wait two weeks! so where will my son sleep? #avoid 
so another 3 points on the same road, half a mile from my house, 3 years apart. #threeplusthreeequalssix #quickmaths 
@ tfl is there an issue with ticket barriers at forest hill? as i have been charged for an incomplete fair 3 times now and i have 100% been tapping in and out correctly!!!!

fuming can’t believe i did nothing today. i am arguably one of the best players at the moment in the 2nd and 3rd team at the moment #inform in all part of the game at least it’s a warm day 
@ jet2tweets absolute joke at manchester today ls760, spent the first half of the england game wandering from carousel to carousel being fed duff information! #footballiscominghomebutyoursuitcasesarent 
i’m sure djocoviks ball bouncing is done to destabilize his opponent #fuming# 
i get fed up of djokovic bouncing his ball teens of times before serving #fuming#

went into @ sainsburys said police told them not to sell alcohol to anyone incase of fighting on the streets! what about people who just want a bottle of wine for dinner? @ metpoliceuk 
sorry but no. my sunny relaxing saturday has just been spoilt because i asked the youngest to do the dishes because the dishwasher hadn’t finished ffs! is it too early for gin?! #mumtoldmenottohaveanykids 
@ hermesparcels ruining my day yet again dont know why @ asos_heretohelp even use them 
absolutely shocking service at @ specsavers in dudley on sunday finally got the problems sorted. but now i'm just getting my stuff ready for work in a few hours. looking forward to wearing my new glasses to find the lens is chipped by the frame. 
never known an internet to be so shit in my entire life @ skyuk wouldnt mind but you contact them & all they say is change the desired channel which does absolutely nothing.. paying over £100 a month for nothing #sortitout 
ugh why is bt broadband so works for 5mins after switching off/resetting then the broadband light goes red again. the live chat people were little use and said we'd have to pay to get someone out -to fix a service we're paying for and not receiving! @ bt_uk @ btcare 
does anyone else get livid if someone is parked in your space, especially when my space is right outside my house?! #getyourownspace #doiwriteanote 
@ skyuk @ skyhelpteam your sky q system is woeful, false advertising, nothing but issues since installed, still no fix!! every night there is an issue! 
@ loveisland so after everything josh did to georgia she thinks it’s acceptable to a) lie and b) take the p!ss out of poor jack by singing at him? #whatacow #loveisland 
when someone dents your car and leaves no note... not even to say sorry! like bro! 
@ frankienbennys i'd hesitate to call this "ultimate" mac and cheese and i'd certainly charge less than £9.00 for it 
bloody wasps everywhere 
@ sw_help do you clean the interior of your carriages? twice in the space of 2 days my clothing has been soiled on your loveable trains! #swtrains 
thanks to the mosquito that bit me twelve times yesterday, i am in a world of itchiness 
with myself. £200 and less than a month .... i've gone and lost my tooth !!!! #fml 
i’m a @ boohoo premier customer and my yearly promise of guaranteed next day delivery seems to be when it suits them. i’m paying for a service they can’t fulfil. surely that’s breach of the trades description act? 
#disgrace football meant to be for the fan 
it’s shameful. i support my local team and of course our national team but there is no way i would behave like this. not so sure the #englandteam would be impressed 
than the front door! am looking forward to winter so i can shut my windows and not hear the loud convos at 11pm in a monday night. #disrespectful #princesscharlottepub 
liar liar liar #teresamay needs to be replaced with a #brexiteer with a brain and who actually cares what the #britishpeople want 
jeremy cunt as foreign secretary?? who’s idea was this???? #atleasthewillleavethenhsalone 
when you're behind on love island and your mate sends you spoilers on snapchat @ billy_blfc 
yes that was just for the fraud which they never told me i had to ring again and i haven't heard about anything else yet and it's been nearly 12 weeks as i put numerous complaints in, i am taking it further now as it's a joke.

cheers to the twat that's keyed my car because they pulled out on me and parked 2 inches away from my door 
can someone explain to me why i've wasted 2 days on the love island game proper gutted that jen has coupled up with the lad i wanted #loveisland 
won't sleep at all tonight 
bought #glasgow #pride tickets on release. terms changed and charged additional for steps. false advertising but i’ll let it go. now those ‘steps tickets’ are being release to the general public at half the price. @ theeveningtimes @ thedailyrecord @ thesun 
she should be offering you a blowie. end of. it's a time for caring for your husbands. my wife is snoring her head off. 
people in the villa be coupled up for three weeks and already getting in exclusive boyfriend/girlfriend relationships ... and here i am with the lad i’ve been talking to for months who doesn’t seem like he’s gonna be asking me the question any time soon #loveisland 
when #loveisland doesn't record cos of the poxy world cup and it's not on catchup yet!! #icouldcry #sortitoutsky 
guess which dickhead lost his wallet days before london then finds it after after cancelling the cards! this dickhead here! #whatawanker 
was buzzing to be home alone for 3 days. then i realised i have to water all of mams fucking plants every night. that is probs more then the botanical gardens. 
we had & tolerated conditions like this in 1985 for miners dispute. 33 years on & nothing changes? bet none of the chiefs will sleep here or their support staff. 
hate these taking part types ! we didn’t capitalise on our chances and fucking lost in the semis 
really aren’t you 
absolutely shocking behaviour tonight @ pizzahutdeliver #worldcuprage 
@ coral at your wordplay on bets. betted the extra time correct score to be 2-1, but apparently it’s 1-0. should be wrote that it renews to 0-0 at extra time for people who don’t bet all the time! ridiculous 
lucky tournament, come against a reasonable side and we get absolutely bossed, setting up to defend after going 1 up in 5 mins #pisstake 
“unlucky england” we have got to win that game from that position. 
when you need to kane to step up he didn’t. was fucking awful tonight. a passenger! didn’t test the keeer at all! 
4 mins added on and croatia spend 3 of them on the floor so he adds an extra 30 seconds #englandvcroatia 
game should of been dead and buried in first half, we didn’t want it as much as them, refs a knob head and world cups not coming home! 
@ stv why did stv player go down in the last minutes of the world cup semi final? 
i honestly do not understand why the #emmyawards seem to just ignore the amazingness of @ cw_crazyxgf and it’s stars! it has everything and the actors are absolutely 100% committed to it. #emmyawards really need to pay attention & wake up!!! @ racheldoesstuff #robbed 
got my screen replaced for going on holiday & i step of the transfer bus & smash it to pieces again #fml 
@ asos_heretohelp order before 11pm for next day delivery is your policy.i ordered at 10:59pm&it's saying delivery is saturday! #help 
just when you think life’s going well for you some arsehole decides to steal your bike 
@ asos customer service has to be the most generic, unhelpful, rigid team i’ve ever come across! #useless 
@ netflixuk any particular reason why i can’t watch sierra burgess is a loser?!!?! 
amount of sausage and egg mcmuffins that could be purchased with that! 
chairman @ repgoodlatte is 
absolutely disgusted with @ harrogatebus. their app clearly shows that i can get the bus from outside northern school of dance to go into leeds town centre. 3 buses have now gone past me shaking their fingers and heads saying no....

i fucking hate mandzukic, spent most of the night on the floor when he’s 8ft fucking 6, then typically the cunt picks himself to bag the winner! 
might phone in sick tomorrow, because i’m sick of people constantly turning up late for shift handover #fuckthis 
why are #purplebricksuk taking months to sort out a house i'm trying to buy? incompetent doesn't even come close 
if there is one thing i cannot and will not tolerate...is people with bad manners! there is absolutely no excuse. it is just rude 
saddened and more than a little bit annoyed that @ southamptoncc, having agreed to manage a couple of local grass areas for #wildlife, have mown the lot down in the height of the #butterfly season!!! not to mention all the other #creatures living there. 
he used my last two i repeat, he used my last two!!!! 
wankers, i would of loved to have seen that poor lion with its pride, and those bastards without there rifles 
this is crazy! favours djok aswell who already had 3 sets under roof so last part should be outdoors. …

wtf #loveisland recorded the show and its run over the time slot so missed some of the episode #why 
i gotta stop watching the news lol some of the dumbest crap comes out of our “president’s” mouth. how about you tweet less and study the history of america instead? 
sort it out @ stn_airport and #ryanair.. we were delayed due to too many planes due to land at same time and now we've been waiting to find out which felt our bags are on for best part of an hour. total delay now over 2 hrs from scheduled time. not good enough 
@ bbcone so annoyed?! keep changing #ourgirl all for bloody football and tennis! it wouldn’t of hurt to put wimbledon or our girl on to @ bbctwo #ourgirl 
@ bbcone not everyone likes tennis you know? could you not put the tennis on the red button 
#fuming. bbc, we aren't all sports fans. first football and now tennis, why cant it continue on bbc2 like normal. ridiculous. 
when @ bbcone keep moving our girl. i’ve been waiting all week for it and now have to wait till tuesday 
as if it has taken us 3 hours to get from ireland (west knock) to london stansted all because of donald trump 
stop editing all of the good bits out. jack & dani had another night in the hideaway? samira & frankie too? you guys are ridiculous!! 
when you do the washing up and there’s that sneaky spoon left in the sink bowl when you empty the water #firstworldproblems 
@ lner fuming! book a seat for coach c to find out there isn't one! no1 to say where to go until everyone was on the packed train. then try to move coach c to b, b to f, f to h, h to k. are u kidding me?? now having to stand coz i cant get through this + my bags!

wait until the neo psych brigade see our next video.... 
absolute joke @ holidayinn garforth leeds. room is so hot, air con on yet deciding to increase the temperature by itself, rang reception and still waiting for someone to show up!! absolutely fuming and now no one is answering at reception!! #hotellife 
just purchased @ dominos pizza for the first time in years! terrible decision, both pizzas were over cooked, hard, and basically no tomato sauce! will not be going back again! #wasteofmoney 
already seeing the effects of bloody, bloody #brexit in northern ireland. brain dead #tories actually giving brain dead #republican thugs an excuse to spread violence and terror. we can't go back to how things were. we just can't. and brexit is increasing tensions. 
@ boboloboyork apparently this is what passes for change at your place. unfortunately for me i didn’t notice until i’d left 
obnoxious silver van driver visiting next door thinks it's ok to block us in, being too lazy to park 'correctly down the road. lazy f...... b......s! @ mpssquirrelshth @ mpshavering 
i’m so pissed. #jabariparker 
she didn’t make it up to those of us who had to leave before she came on 90 minutes late @ brentwoodfest 
@ odeoncinemas what a joke!! allowing a 16 year old in your gallery twice before and now stop it because it’s illegal under 18. well you broke the law yourselves allowing a 16 year old in there twice before! 
shit the bed i had everton 22 - 1 
was chuffed to discover the rafa v novak @ wimbledon semi-final was being shown on the @ sport24live channel while on my @ etihadairways flight from manchester.... until it got to a crucial stage of the match at 6-6 and they decided to switch to the football 
there is no doubt in my mind that without that roof and stupid scheduling by wimbledon rafa would have been biting on the trophy tomorrow so basically wimbledon have cost rafa the title. #wimbeldon #wimbledon2018 #gutted 
still salty that i couldn’t get tickets to #pokemongofest2018 and i hopped on that shit the second they went on sale ... they need to fix the ticket purchasing process. 
note to self never ever use @ treatwelluk again. 3 appointments booked today and 3 times i have been told the places don’t have my bookings!!!! what a waste of an afternoon #poorcustomerservice 
they defo kept twitter bingo tame @ loveisland 
so there's just me, my dad, jade and kaison in pub watching england! the "it's coming home" people have truly fucked off! #cheerwhenwerewinning #eng 
argumentative bastards, i can feel a banged up abroad coming on 
when the uber driver picks up your food then cancels the order, and fucks off with your food. @ harvest_dubois 
i am soooo angry at the @ argos_online delivery drivers, seriously rude, shouting at me and then drove off without delivering the replacement fridge, because removing the faulty one wasn’t on their sheet 
@mceinsurance #dickturpin. £20 on a premium number and they still didn’t quote me a half decent price on my renewal. #goingelsewhere 
georgia #loveisland 
are only british people allowed a glass of water in mayfair? @ londonmarriott @ sadiqkhan #grosvenorsquare 
when you fly @ british_airways seat 1c and the person behind you cannot put his bag under the empty middle seat behind you and instead insists he should have two empty seats for his hand luggage and his leg space.... #absolutelyridiculous #completewanker #bastaffgonemad 
so angry sitting at nice airport and flight being 5hrs delayed until 02.00– shocking and extremely extremely exasperated. #easyjet #crapjet @ easyjet 
@ quotemehappy am absolutely not happy!!! i have been trying to find out what my cancellation cost would be. i specifically said i didn’t want to cancel yet and if/when i did i would do it online. now callum has just decided to cancel my policy!!! #nothappy 
shout out the the worst and rudest staff i’ve come across at #frankieandbennys at @ manchesterairp absolute twats!!!!! 
i'm beyond angry, i missed out on £950 because i accidentally bet on croatia 4 - 2, instead of france 4 - 2. let that be a lesson to anyone, always check you've made the correct selection, especially on correct score market. 
martial must be at home throwing darts at a picture of mourinho #fra #worldcupfinal 
@ elisjames @ nomadicrevery check this irritant out. imagine my joy listening to this after the cancellation of my train, a bus to warrington & a five and a half hour journey to london that meant i missed the wc final. #wackaging 
. @ h_lloris just cost me £200. 
@ skybet thanks lloris for fucking up my bet, fuming!!! #worldcup 
ref cost me over £150 there with @ betvictor for not booking brozovic for booting the ball away when that is a standard yellow card #wcfinal 
you know you’re having a bad day when ya mrs sells a signed @ janaagefjortoft 1994 swindon shirt by mistake at a car boot.! 
i'm disgusted france will win world cup #worldcup2018 #somad 
what’s with the subs invading the pitch? remember when @ benmurphy2802 and the coxall brothers invaded the pitch at petersfield and murphy got booked #worldcupfinal 
can’t believe i didn’t put a bet on france to win when i called it weeks ago 
deer wrecked our tomato plants. 
roy keane at half time brilliant, the guy just cracks me up #idiot 
roy keane is tv gold #worldcupfinal 
@ officialplt have only sent me half my order... what am i meant to do with just bikini tops and no bottoms and i paid for it all.. bet it’s out of stock now 
dad ate my whole bag of maltesers out the fridge 
just been to see hamilton the musical. really pissed off, as it happens. nothing on the bust-up with sebastian vettel or ron dennis's departure from mclaren. typical hollywood - giving it all an american twist. enjoyed the singing, mind. #fourtimeworldchampion 
omg crying this is actually me. i need to sort my life out.. on top of that gotta wait til 23rd july for the next episode to be released but you know me boo, im georgia and i’m #loyal to the game 
@ nwpolice the girls and lads in this car were trying to sell my son drugs tonight on black rock beach at about 9pm, then she drove towards my wife 
a draw wins us the league. #fm18 #footballmanager 
unfortunately i don't have it recorded. my camera was in photo mode 
don’t understand how @ georgia_steel is still in the villa and @ ellieobrown isn’t 
how many fucking lives does that meghan have ??? #loveisland 
#loveisiand 
when you find out your fella ate the food you were going to have, … 
just put our girl on from friday that i recorded for it to be wimbledon #ourgirl 
#theairwebreathe when it comes down to it what really matters 
proper fuming @ itv not enough that soaps were all over place with world cup now @ itvcorrie is not on until 9.30 because of another stupid talent contest , who even cares if a kid can sing it clashes with @ loveisland now so can only watch one 
@ scottishpower - disgraceful organisation trying to steal money via inaccurate estimates, refuse to update meter readings and lie when they say complaints team or manager will call. going on for over 6 month's!!! 
it’s been 15 mins and still no real information!! @ vueling #flighttoparis #fuming! 
@ aldiuk how is this a medallion steak? the whole point of these is because the fat is trimmed off already 
@ thomascookuk fantastic customer service #hold for 35minutes only to be told that all the staff have gone for a meeting and to call back in 1 hour #joke company #fuming. 
@ easyjet so i still have to get to the airport for 7:15pm despite my flight being almost 2 hours delayed and now doesn’t depart until 22:50. what’s the point in that?! 
so now i will miss my children performing in a show because of a faulty train (also with no air conditioning). had your communication been better, i could've got the 1705. thanks for ruining my evening and disappointing & upsetting my children. 
my emoji for @ tfl after spending nearly 26 minutes trying to pay congestion charge and getting the sorry were fixing something message!!!!! i hope you're fixing the waiver of the pcn i absolutely won't be paying 
really sincere girl. alexandra deserves better than alex #loveisland 
ffs alex!! the first girl to genuinely like you and you are thinking about throwing it away!! just showing that all men are the same deep down!! #loveisland 
@ kiergroup have shocking customer service standards shouldn’t take nearly 3 weeks to get back money that is rightly yours when you’ve been assured you’d have it back within 3 days! 
lovely husband bought back ‘healthy’ super whole grain mix from @ marksandspencer ... turns out it’s over 500 calories a packet! insane for something that definitely tasted like it’s good for you. look at all the thing i could have had instead! 
why would @ kendalcalling put catfish & the bottlemen and tom grennan on at the same time, on the same day! 
@ ups think it's acceptable to deliver this to the wrong address and throw it over a 6ft fence!! @ scentsy 
this is ridiculous- i will now boycott wework!!! 
@ ee @ ee please tell me how it is possible to run out of 30gb of data in 4 days when i have only been in for like less then 2 days! #ridiculous 
pissed of craving garlic bread, dad went and got some and cooked it! nah get this there was no gralic butter in there, was like eating a plain break stick! 
dear @ sportsdirect_cs with no store manager to help us. we were referred to your cs phone line. only to be told "our lines are too busy - call back later"... when we did, it took 30 mins to then be cut off at the point of greeting. #disgraceful 
i was really enjoying munching on these whilst driving until some dickhead trucker pulled out on me and they ended up like this in the passenger footwell . #pringles … 
yes, and not the job of toy companies and toy retailers to endanger them #fuming, i mean, read that again, toy companies/retailers putting kids in way #itmakesnosense 
b..... ridiculous. that's to take more people out of the pip criteria and could disadvantage the many unemployed asds! 
it's not often i travel by train and i now know why @ greateranglia. yet again another cancellation into liverpool st from ipswich there always seems to be permanent problems on this line. #lateformybirthdaytreat #dontbookinadvance 
bought packs of oreos to make oreo cupcakes for my brothers birthday tomorrow, to find out he doesn’t like oreos who the fuck doesn’t like oreos?! 
@ asdaserviceteam when you are disabled and rely on home delivery for groceries, sit and wait for 2 hour delivery slot but 5 mins before it's up, this text is received!!! 
my mil does my head in, attention seeker, liar, putting others down 
the most annoying thing is that, without my permission, she has now given my number to all the people in her team, half of them i don't even know! 
this programmes bullshit and i hope the 'bailiff' feels bad. a young kid took his life over a £500 debt! #cunts #killedbymydebt 
can’t believe jack is cracking on with a new bird #noloyalty #horny 
apparently 2 people have left the villa. if it’s jack and dani that means megan and wes will win. i guarantee it! 
can’t wait until nike become our kit partner. 
fuckn single pimple nestled itself right in the middle of my forehead.. looking like a proper chocolate unicorn me 
#southwesternrailway you really are crap beyond belief! service is undoubtably worse since you took over! #shitservice 
honestly so fucking sick of south western railway - sat on a non air conditioned train for 38 minutes. do you refund so appointments that i’ve missed?? #stopdelayingmegettinghome #sogladipaythoundsofpoundsforthis 
a girl on my bus has just got her first ever pay slip from a job and discovered tax. she is on the phone to someone: 'what is tax' 
@ virginmedia absolutely disgusted... get through to cancellations and lady says just let me pop you on hold.. 15 mins later and i’m getting charged for this call!! #takingthep 
does not appreciate being lied to.... 
any list of great travel writing which contains paul theroux's name is automatically invalidated for me: nothing 'great' about holocaust jokes and perving after every woman he sees (and then feeling righteous for not having sex with her). 
@ dpd_uk seriously not impressed, took a parcel to a pick up point for collection on monday, to find out it’s still there, couriers refusing to take as full load!! seriously it’s a tiny parcel that needs to be back with sender .. trying to ring you!! no answer 
@ metrouk @ dailymailuk @ thesun @ getwestlondon @ uxbridgegazette @ asdaserviceteam take forever to sort issues out, this has been going on for over a week, totally #dissatisfied aasda don't care!!! 
@ scottishpower always had prepayment meters with yourselves. moved house sent me a bill £1000+ i always had to pay upfront before i got gas, this is not my debt or my problem. fault lies with you. needs sorting or i will cancel you supplying my new address 
thank you @ tesco for your employees who park in the street all day long outside your head office making it impossible for residents with children to park outside their own homes. cmon @ welhatcouncil sort this out. 
how the fuck have my former housemates racked up an additional £800 in utility bills since i moved out in march? and the dickheads/glide expect me to pay my "share" of £270 despite not using any fucking gas, leccy or water? fuck off. #areyouhavingagiraffe 
fuming! none of the mandem are working at the hotel on saturday with me and im the only guy working a shift from 1 till midnight 
so @ british_airways cancel my sons flight home which i’ve paid premium cabin for, put him & his new wife on a non direct flight taking 4 hours longer & downgrade to economy with no compensation, a joke surely? no it’s true his 1st trip back home in 18mths #angry #ripoff 
fascinating insight in to #prison @ channel4 can't help but resent paying taxes for these criminals to deal drugs and watch countdown and earn money all day. too much #luxury 
u leave your daughter with her nannan for 1hr and she lets her shave half her eyebrow off 
@ flight_refunds thanks for the retweet @ britishairways have changed our flight from lgw to london city airport! #inconvenient 
our car hates me! had to cancel a meeting cause the stupid electric seat won’t move to my position for half an hour now... mind you, my husband is significantly taller than i am (everyone is significantly taller than i am, tbh). i cannot reach the pedals. fml 
@ skyhelpteam well thank you for being completely ffffing useless. you can fly your sports presenters around the world ba business class (we see it on insta) but you cannot invest in competent back office to process orders from long standing customers like me. 
my life consists of the countdown to 9pm for @ loveisland how times have changed! #loveisland 
the systems in this country are ridiculous.. lazy arses can get everything but the terminally ill get nothing.. #5hoursgettingnowhere #iwillfight4udaddy 
that point when you lose your temper so badly all the veins on your neck are visible and you feel like your head will explode 
and a missed penalty a few minutes from time costs us. 
mickey-mouse sentence though :( although apparently he didn't intend to hurt anyone when he rammed you 
drive 30 minutes of town just for some cunt to cancel on you 5 minutes from their house 
@ british_airways #awfulservice online check in didn't work, arrive at the airport no seat for us on the plane (109 flight) bag check didn't accept our bag, eventually given seats apart no apology and no sense of urgency. @ heathrowairport 
no percy or barba. #allbetsdown should of given them a hiding ffs!! @ giggymike 
seeing all these people with kids going on holidays abroard without them and me n my mrs cant even get a babysitter for a night 
@ bigchefandrew hi, @ chartwells_uk absolute ridiculous conversation today with chartwells. clearly do not care! #childsafety 
buffy getting a reboot? worse idea ever!!!! don't do it! #bestshow #lazy #nonewideas 
i did not endure a flight with turbulence and a roasting tube journey to be greeted with the news that #loveisland isn't on the itv hub yet. don't they know how loyal a viewer i am? 
how rude is this @ deliveroo customer services representative! just leaving the chat when i am in the middle of complaining. my food should be here now and my driver has only just arrived at the restaurant as they were waiting for almost an hour now to assign a driver 
@ virginmedia can't believe you are getting rid of dave, gold etc. so disappointed! what a way to turn customers to sky?! unbelievable 
@ jamesgunn has allegedly been fired #gotg3 for tweets from 2008-11. how can #gotg3 go on without him...he is guardian of this galaxy..... #badmovedisney 
extremely disappointed by the poor customer service received by @ askplaystation just now. if this issue is not resolved, i will be cancelling my @ ps_vue and we will not purchase any other ps items. #unacceptable #clearlynotacustomerorientedcompany 
i really hate how @ virginmedia assume everyone watches on demand and catch up, i dont, no one else in the house does, i want to watch #harrowuk @ taskmaster @ ronjichardson and @ mosthauntedexp as it was intendeded, on the day its on and on my tv!!!!! 
well your lying ain’t you!!! how has my flight been delayed by 4 hours!! no got to sit in a airport for 4 and a half hours!!! #terriblecustomerservice #liars 
@ spotifycares i demand an explanation on why i continue to get the notification of my account being in use somewhere else. i haven't opened it on anything else so tell me where you think its being used and then i'll tell you whether someone's hacking it. 
what?! thanks for the heads up @ virginmedia … 
@ dpd_uk the worst service i've ever known with not much better customer services.7 days, 8 phone calls with 8 different stories and still no parcel!unless i go and get it myself tomorrow even though i've paid for it to be delivered 7 days ago! 
@ parcel2go i have dm you yet again as i still don't have my parcel i would have been quicker if i travelled to england and picked the fucker up myself 
just wasted an hour of my life trying to resolve extra charges on my bill @ vodafoneuk absolutely shocking customer experience #trainyourstaffproperly 
unbelievably bad customer service from @johnlewisretail today. been on phone for an hour trying to sort out delivery to be told i have to ring another dept because there’s a 40 minute wait and they’re not willing to call me back #shambles 
this is a train to scotland, for which everyone paid approx. £80 with no seats bookable. @ lner you should be ashamed. 
happened too me as well a few years back but they didn't leave a note. 
#meh #pissedoff #goodstarttomyweekaway 
fuck you nationwide, i can say what i damn well like and in fact, you've lost a long standing customer. my account has never been compromised more than being with you 
@ natwest_help what you meant todo when your in los angeles trying to book taxi for england for when i land and card gets blocked? i can see a bank change soon as i fucking land 
i can't live without del trotter! 
abso-fuckin-lutely, my girl! #heartbroken & 
i’m enjoying breakfast on saturday with my family and this! 
@ savershb you really should give more training to your managers, they have no idea how to treat their customers!!! 
saturday night working has got to be the worst thing on planet in terms of work life #enjoyyoursaturday #nhsgrafter 
still no @ riverisland order! supposed to be delivered friday! then they said saturday! still not here! not impressed as i need the outfit for a wedding tomorrow!! #joke not even a response from customer service! 
@ tesco since when can’t a 26yr old buy alcohol with id cos she has her younger sister with her ?? and she’s 12 and was asked for id. #bradleystoke 
ordered dinner on @ scoffable at 17:13 estimated delivery of 2hr 40min just rang restaurant and they don’t have a delivery driver in for another few hours and only way to contact is an online form! this is totally unacceptable!!! 
these are the only channels worth watching out of hundreds. who wants to watch american garbage.. looks like ill be looking for a new provider as not worth the money 
what annoys me most is the inaccuracies in the story. the lyrics he sings are from stormbringer, not smoke on the water.

what an absolute joke! gold is literally the only channel i watch. another poor move virgin, looking through the comments on this post, you've clearly massively underestimated the huge volume of people who watch these channels 
imagine being really excited that your boyfriend is bringing you some nuggets home only to find out mcdonald’s is shut! 
i was at flamborough kicking sand in everyone’s face!!! 
hi @ pizzahutuk why give the option for additional instructions to completely ignore them?

@ wagamama_uk hi, regular customer here - just had a curt phone call with a branch saying that allergies can’t be accommodated for on deliveroo. that’s unacceptable - i’ve done it before - i just place my order and give the restaurant a quick call to remove one ingredient. 
i know, we've lost some decent channels and they're putting the price up next month 
i’ve just spent 50 mins on hold!! i’ve just given up!! 50 mins on a sunday evening!! if i am charged an inordinate amount of money for that call i’m not going to be impressed! #shitservice #sunday #stillnonethewiser 
@ virgin what are you going to do about @ virginmedia? they have just screwed over all of there customers and don't give a toss that they are all very angry. or is that what @ richardbranson s brand has become. all about the profit nothing to do with doing the right thing. 
oh yeah i’m great me. #passthewordaround haha 
love paying £13 for #peterrabbit @ virginmedia then i can’t watch it!! supposed to be easier than buying the dvd and you can re watch when you want? no you can’t!! #joke

@ plusnet unbelievable!!! another missed deadline, another call, and hung up on again! is this your new standard response when the question is too hard to answer? #outrageous #specialmeasures 
if dani and jack spilt up i refuse to watch love island again 
love dani & jack but do not agree w/ tonight’s episodeyou cannot have the hump w/ your significant other for a lie detector result when they still haven’t done anything wrong! bin him off if he does cheat but don’t call him a cheat before the fact-not fair! 
just finished work and found that @ alibi_channel @ goldchannel are gone from @ virginmedia - this needs sorting or we're going to have to change supplier. 
my parcel arrived damaged and with missing items and nobody has bothered to respond to my 4 dm messages plus am email 
she also *refused* to come with me to see jeff. hence why i’ve now missed it

@ tpexpresstrains not only have you extended my journey between leeds and stalybridge by 20 minutes turning my express train into a local stopping service but then consistently turn it back into an express service when it is running late without a stalybridge stop. 
they were making me feel guilty of something i wasn't really aware of. i was #fuming, and at that point i didn't want to rent a car from them anymore. it was afterwards when i realised what they did to me: 
@ stokecity why didn't we have 10 of these

#loveisland mr watching alex dump alexandra is like when harry sees snape kill dumbledore.... 
alex go home!! i’ve had enough image this prick has been spon fed women finally lads an absolute rocket and is dumping her...again! 
when you only buy 1 bottle of #weissbier 'to be sensible'...then you pour it badly and some frothes over the top of the glass and it's wasted!!

i’ve sat and watched and waited for 8 whole weeks and @ mrddyer isn’t even going to step foot in the @ loveisland villa!! 
to say i'm pissed off is an understatement why isn't danny dyer going into the villa!! waited the whole 8 weeks for this!! #loveisland 
i’ve been waiting all series for danny dyer to go into the villa #loveisland 
why is @ mrddyer not in the villa? can’t believe i’ve kept watching #loveisland just to see him going in the villa, to find out it’s not happening im boycotting no lie 
so we’ve got brexit, we didn’t win the world cup and danny dyer isn’t going into the villa #loveisland

love sitting on the plane waiting for the flight to be cancelled 
@ virginatlantic you’ve cancelled our flight and now you’ve “sorted” transport back to the airport where we will be at the airport for over four hours before our flight. thanks for ruining our holiday and undoing all the good the break has done

after defending @ utilitaenergy way back in the cold weather, it's a kick in the teeth to have a £50 charge added to my account for a "replacement" handset despite it being my first handset... and... that's after being told at least five times it wouldn't happen. 
been waiting 8 weeks #loveisand #inthestyle @ inthestyleuk @

@ rflreferees so you tip a player on his head who then loses the ball & you give a knock on.......yet the same play in.the first half gets the player 10 minutes in the bin. all you want is consistency from referees instead of being one sided #slwidcas 
i dont think just an appology is enough to be honest, i had my battery taken from me and that has travelled the world with me, i feel i should be compensated for this! especially when i was told by 2 members of ba i could take it with me #ithinkyoumayhavelostacustomer

would strongly advise everyone never to go with @ watkin_jones when it comes to new builds. the amount of times they given us incorrect moving in dates and now because they taken so long the mortgage offer is about to expire unless i pay an extra £90 #neveragain 
or they refund my money in full + delivery. they couldn't even process the refund and will "get back to me". this is possibly the worst customer service i have ever received from a store. @ netaporter #worstcustomerservice #dontshophere 
@ yodelonline your delivery driver didn't even bother to deliver my item when stated & i have just been treated appallingly by your 'customer service' department..basically accused of lying about bieng at my home address when delivery attempted. a total lack of empathy. 
boring homeowner question: if someone does work on a roof and offers a warranty then, when it’s necessary to ask them to honour that warranty they do fuck all, mess you about, and cause serious issues between you and a neighbour can you sue their sorry asses? 
well that was great to find out before bedtime. 
waiting in for @ km_hard 10 year wedding anniversary present to arrive, @ dhlexpressuk van drives straight past the house then texts to say they’ve tried to deliver my parcel. wont come back until this afternoon when we will be out cos we’re going away. #poorservice

@ eonenergyuk i don’t appreciate being sighed at when i’m trying to explain to the cs advisor that putting my monthly direct debits up by nearly 50% isn’t justified when i have only gone over one quarterly tariff by £8 especially when i’m under by £58 this quarter! 
what do you have to do to get a burnley away ticket in a ballot 3yrs in row chubbed..! 
shocking service from @ btsport yet again.. tried cancelling it twice now in two months only to be told a different contract end date. obviously the cancellation charge is very important! costing me time and money each time i call. #impossibletask

i teach in pupils' houses. i refute this picture of working class life. i'm actually so angry at this. lazy, stereotypical, elitist bullshit. this person should not be around disadvantaged children. 
fuming that @ bestival website said 17 cans each and that's it, but when you get here 24 cans plus a 70cl of spirits #fuming. does this mean i can bring the rest of my alcohol in on re-entry? #shameonyou 
just called @ ikeauk #customerservice about a missing delivery (delivery 18 items missed off an order) - waited 14 mins for call to be answered - then out on hold for 10 mins- then cut off! 
just listened again, how dare he try and compare convicted criminal tr, with the brave young men who fought and died for freedom and against fascism in the battle of britain. using them as comparison to that racist thug & bigot by that racist is obscene. #fuming. 
fraudsters have cloned my card, yet i'm always so careful how and where i use it. 
absolutely terrible delivery service from @ claireabellaltd i have now been informed that @ royalmail has lost my order. this was supposed to be a birthday present for next week. 
when @ bhamcitycouncil haven't collected your recycling bins in 2 months yet every time i raise a missed collection ticket via their website it gets closed but still no bin collection... 
like it’s not hot enough already i’ve just lost a fucking spider #sweating #goingtodie

bar not open at wheathampstead

the problem with this country isn't all the working/tax paying migrants. it's my benefit claiming family of 5 neighbours all in the hot tub in the swanky garden blasting the tunes living it up when working families can't get by 
was away with the lads in malaga gutted at not being there at old trafford while watching arsenal win the league against everton bouncing off the walls

@ ryanair flight to budapest meant to depart from stanstead at 11:45. boarded at 1:30 and we are still sitting on the plane by the gate. no information! this is really cutting into our short holiday. 
can’t believe @ wafcchairman didn’t make the bench 
should @ vueling not be #fuming! have a good break, when you get there. you have to admit there are some benefits to holidaying on barry island! particularly this year? … 
just had a really awkward moment playing monopoly online. tommy ended up in jail and some islamist ended up buying mayfair! 
i just did several loads of laundry and folded it on the bed, for my three year old to go in and toss it all on the floor. i genuinely feel like i want to cry. #momlife #toddler

omg i cant believe @ itzlaurennn_ is actually pregnant! & its not even mine! #dramaalert 
if this #loveislandreunion is just gonna show us instagram posts that i’ve already seen. then i wasted £3 on dips and crisps!! #loveisland 
a game of netball takes an hour and a half - a game of club cricket seems to take all day and all night. am mighty hacked off. #starving #knackered #homealone 
when you do the @ mcdonaldsuk drive thru then get home to find they didn’t put the nuggets in... #mcdonalds #nonuggets

@ amz_harks your such a lazy cunt, you have proper ruined my sunday #canttakenomore #firstevertweet 
nothing like waking up to being yelled at about “losing” the car keys, only after 30 mins of fighting and looking realize they were under the persons nose to begin with in a location they put them! #dontprojectyourshitonme 
i know mate. i walked away completely disgusted with ramsey’s behaviour. how dare he pose for countless photos & shake everyone’s hand but refuse a 60 minute 1 on 1 chat (which would only benefit me & my podcast) 
@ cpwtweets shocking service. drove to leeds for your same day screen repair @briggate, to be told you dont have parts or trained staff working(youre not sure if theyre in next weekend!) then spend ages ringing birstall & noone answers! #falseadvertising 
@ scousertommy10 seems someone got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning

i have a very hardworking 17 year old boy... he’s been getting up early every day to go to work, working 10 hours a day , 6 days a week for £65 and to be spoken to like trash 
@ btcare i have had no wifi now since the 28th of july i reported it as a fault on that date and was told it would be fixed by the 31st still wasn’t fixed, after loads of phone calls i was told it would be fixed today 6th but still no internet. bad customer service!!! # 
really poor service from @ e4u_babies, placed an order, they took the money, and no delivery. can’t get through on the phone, and email address bounces back. shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it. really poor! #poorcustomerservice #donotorderfromthem 
@ tesco absolutely outraged. not only was your stroud store empty with supplies, i bought some of your fishcakes for tea this week..... only to find out that they went out of date yesterday, the same day i purchased them

bad food, bad service, terrible toilets, no dairy-free alternatives all served without a smile in what felt essentially like a sauna. never been so tempted to dine and dash. 
appalling service from @ dpd_uk no delivery sat as driver apparently couldn’t find my address! we live on a bus route!!! no delivery 2day and absolute poor customer service of just hitting automatic buttons to answer questions #poorcustomerservice #wheresmyparcel #dpduk 
how dare you think that, my opinion on inbetweeners is positive! whi isnt yours? #gamer #inbetweeners #السعوديه_تطرد_السفير_الكندي 
@ travelrepublic paid for a 45min transfer, got on this bus over 2hrs ago! #stillnotatthehotel 
so tonight i have been a victim of crime. it really does make you feel violated that someone has taken your property without you knowing. #heartbroken i hope whoever took my beautiful bike is found soon!

ring the gp to make an appointment to get an ultrasound form due to having a potential slap lesion which is a torn cartilage in my shoulder that may need urgent surgery and they tell me there’s no appointments till the end of august 
yesterday a lady at work aged 64 was expected to work 10 hours with no one to do her break , the manager took a cup of coffee to her, if i was in work yesterday think the coffee would have been shoved up ... she can retire at 66 with the worst pension in developed world

i’m properly enraged,not only have i just found out that a site that doesn’t need a refit is getting one before my site which is fucking well falling apart does. i’ve just been followed by a van driver who is the reason why van drivers are given a bad name.

just because you write a book doesn’t mean you definitively know. patricia reed demonstrates an opinion is just that. an opinion. your client should have legal recourse against her in the face of the overwhelming evidence. 
i was froze out for 45 mins then when i came back i had lost 3/4 of my stack where 1 player was still active and min raising every hand and it folds everyone else $9k for the winner and i cash a measly $40 when i was well in with a shout before it crashed #absolutejoke

why can't i watch series 3 of @ loveisland on @ itvhub? yet it's being advertised? #falseadvertising 
salah is a fake fraud. i got exactly the same response when i beeped my horn outside his house at 3 in the morning with my music on full blast when he had just got back from an away match, he refused to sign my 18 shirts and everyone else’s in the mini bus. 
i’m slightly comforted by the thought that in her ‘expert’ catalogue is a fake ceramic jug and one day wyatt will let her know in a two page letter. 
snakiest thing ever when your told your having chinese for dinner to come home from work and find out no one ordered you any 
@ curryspcworld bad show today! told our oven was going to arrive between 0920 - 1320....it is now 2014 and still no sign. we've rung customer service 5 times & promised calls back but did not happen & looks like driver went awol! #cannotcook #nopay

@ parcelforce what is the point in asking where i'd like my parcel to be delivered to if i'm not in to collect it, just to ignore it? twice they've tried, twice they've ignored it. and now i'm without a critical delivery that i need for my business tonight. #notgoodenough

@ gregwrightyp honestly northern rail is a joke... stuck on train that was 'only' a few mins late departing. when it set off it went down the wrong track only to be told we will reverse and correct it and now we are sat back in leeds to be told it's cancelled #northernfail 
i'd love to see their social media policy and why they'd block someone reporting a crime 
@ coral so i’ve put loads of bets on tonight and had some loose due to drawing yet they won on penalties not extra time so how can that bet loose with the new system in the carbaro cup!!!!!!!! it’s doesn’t state in 90 mins just the end result

@ thetrainline now just been advised to use my tickets for the wrong day “at users discression”!! so i’ll be getting a fine and being actively encouraged by train line to not even bother travelling with a valid ticket. #whatajoke 
can’t believe someone has had the cheek to change the default browser on my work computer 
@ weareopenreach @ openreachhelp @ bt_uk what a load of crap!! ordered in july so could be set up before i return to work sept 5th, had no end of trouble with the ordered to now be told open reach won’t give them a date for install or the outside work to be done #crapservic

gwynab rywun anhapus ofnadwy @ kenowens1088. what a massive compliment for ken. huge kick in the teeth for me. … 
why is that little prick simon barlow back on @ itvcorrie 
not worth the hassle getting rid of you #alwaysme 
when @ hmvtweets liverpool one say they are open until 8pm...but really they close at 7:50... its okay...i will take my custom elsehwere...no wonder places go bust when they close early to customers... 
thoroughly ashamed to have ever watched @ loosewomen you stooped so low today to set up and embarrass another woman. i don't side with kim but coleen is a nasty bully who you employ to increase ratings. you could have gone to a break when it kicked off. couldn't you? 
when you come to collect your tu parcels from @ sainsburys and they can only find one of your parcels. i've clearly nothing better to do then stand and wait around for 35 minutes after a long day at work 
@ tesco went to have dinner tonight and realised this i brought yesterday is already out of date. why is it on the self #nodinner 
disgusting @ tlrailuk - how can you announce 1st class is declassified then send on the inspectors to give out penalty fares!! unbelievable #gottogetyourmoneybacksomehow #disgrace 
#@vodafoneuk #poorcustomerservice - 48 hours with no data through “technical problems” at vodafone end & 4 x hour long conversations & still not sorted & so no data to make internet phone calls to teenage daughters in australia - #fobbedoff 
@ tesco looking forward to my dinner tonight and already out of date brought it yesterday. what’s it doing on the shelves #nodinner 
it was a joke you absolute dick!! @ ryanjamesthomas was clearly fucking around you grade a bellend!!!!! #cbb 
so sad that she needed to use ryan in such a manner love ryan the man is harmless and on no level what so ever does he deserve this #getroxyout 
i’m so shocked that big brother is pandering to her needs as well!!! clearly ur bro did nothing wrong and trust me the millions all witnessed that tonight!!! 
@ ryanjamesthomas @ scottyspecial what an idiotic vindictive attention seeker roxanne is! laughing after and then decided she will cry and is scared #awfulbehaviour #attentionseeker 
just caught up with #cbb tonight. #roxy needs to be spoken to about her accusations, not #ryan being spoken to, do you want to ruin his career!! now to say she doesn’t feel safe in the house with him...there are women out there going through real abuse 
#bbuk i can’t believe roxanne would accuse ryan of punching her... so it’s ok for ben to throw her around!!! stupid cow!!! #getroxanneout she should be removed 
#getroxyout now she is deranged not to mention incredibly sly devious and dishonest i can’t believe what i watched tonight she could destroy an innocent mans reputation!! she won’t because everyone has seen he did nothing wrong but she still needs to go!! #cbb 
omg @ scottyspecial @ lucy_meck who is this idiot on #cbbots actually trying to justify roxannes accusations against ryan , is she actually joking 
agreed she has to be removed!!! i am actually gobsmacked wtf is she on!! #cbb #getroxanneout 
they should not have given ryan a formal warning for that! that's shameful! 'big brother, call me into the diary room please ' just fucking walk in yourself! she should be the one who got the formal warning trying to destroy the poor man!! #cbb #disgrace 
she’s trying to cause another drama to take the light from the ben drama 
maybe roxanne would like to go and live through the real violent abuse i’ve received and then complain about someone having fun energy around her. 
i don’t even have words for roxanne right now.. so attention seeking all the time and is now trying to get one of the nicest, most genuine housemates removed for absolutely nothing?! it makes no sense.. literally had no words watching that tonight #cbb 
i would be absolutely raging if i was @ lucy_meck @ adamthomas21 or @ scottyspecial and i saw tonight's ep of #cbb and couldn't do anything but watch!! that roxanne is an absolute fruit loop! 
i’ve just complained to ofcom too @ lucy_meck @ keeleymcrowv , feel so so strongly about it. absolutely disgusted that she’s been given spare room & the air time to make these claims. #fuming#manipulative#nastypieceofwork 
hold up. @ netflixuk why is the ending of the notebook different? i'm waiting for that end scene to dry up my tear ducts, and it never came? care to explain? 
crikey catchin up with #cbb and actually cannot believe what im seeing..why has @ ryanjamesthomas even had to apologize to that physco!! switched off! no way is that acceptable way to treat ryan when hes done nothing wrong get roxy out 
@ bbuk come on this is a disgrace!! she’s a liar and a complete disgrace.. #getherout @ ryanjamesthomas you are are an amazing guy #dontletherwin 
absolutely disgraceful, please share and find this utter shit someone must recognise this little dog #nameandshame … 
still can’t get over the shame of the roxanne woman on @ bbuk why have they no shown the clip to the housemates rather than leaving them believing her lies! #fuming! 
throw it back old school get a plane and banner above that house.. these boys need to know she's a compulsive liar, you can just see she's going to get them voting for ryan in next noms #getroxanneout #cbb @ bbuk @ scottyspecial @ lucy_meck 
@ skyuk i am livid! why have i been charged £15 for a service that 1- didn’t happen & 2- is the fault of yourselves with poor internet speeds!! miles below the minimum speed you should be providing! #cannotwaittocancel 
@ ryanair as if this is the new “cabin luggage” size! it’s the size of my handbag! just bought a bloody new cabin bag yesterday and now new rules!!! 
i'm furious with @ channel5_tv @ bbuk over this! this is utterly despicable. she should be removed without any eviction. she's going to cause a lot of psychological damage! 
@ ryanjamesthomas #bbuk you should play the clip of " ryan assaulting roxanne " to the housemates let them see what a dangerous snake she is!!! 
seething watching #cbb get roxy out the lying cretin @ ryanjamesthomas you’ve done nothing wrong 
@ bbuk what a fix sorry, i’m so disgusted and disappointed that roxy hasn’t gone and i believe that you have stopped that happening to protect her further, she should be made to finish what she started 
why are they not letting the house hear the crowd? why did they only announce the bottom two people? why did housemates have to close the door? why are they protecting roxy from hearing boos and ‘get roxy out’? i’m so annoyed they’re protecting her #cbb #cbbuk 
made my first complaint to @ ofcom tonight about #cbb genuine victims of violence live in genuine fear of their perpetrators! roxanne claiming she was visciously assaulted in an unprovoked attack is absolutely appalling!! she needs removing from the house! 
come join in... let’s all have a talk about tonight’s program together... i’m completely calm and placid about it all - honest click the link to join!!!!!!! #cbb … 
if anyone can't get a ticket for arsenal, i've got a season ticket but can't go. i won't buy you one, i just want a laugh. if i can't go then neither can you. 
always refreshing to open up twitter and see the same opinions, roxanne throwing potentially career ending allegations around like sweets, disgraceful and disrespectful to anyone suffering from domestic abuse! #cbb #roxanne #getroxanneout 
seriously dont think i can watch this anymore its giving me a sick feeling.. poor ryan looks so deflated, why arnt @ bbuk stepping in and stopping her, give that scrag a oscar 
roxy doesn’t deserve to be able to walk out without facing the crowd or being interviewed #ryantowin #cbb 
i agree! 
@ bbuk never have i hated a housemate as much as i do roxanne, i had her card marked on day 1 @ lucy_meck it must be so heartbreaking for you to watch @ ryanjamesthomas i feel so sorry for him! lets hope bb do the right thing and show him the footage 
tonight’s episode of cbb has made me sick to my stomach!! how dare roxanne say this is why women don’t speak out. it makes me so angry she can twist what was meant as a joke to this level that it’s made ryan feel this bad i’m furious!!! #cbbuk #ryan 
thank god that stupid girl has walked!!! no doubt she’d have been voted out anyway!! what a liability! #teamryan #cbbuk @ cbb #cbbbots 
it’s actually breaking my heart watching ryan sob his heart out in the diary room. what a nasty bitch to do that to someone. seems like a genuinely nice bloke @ cbb @ celebbigbrother he doesn’t deserve this. sort it out big brother! #ryantowin 
hope the door smacks her straight in the face 
watching cbb thinking how roxanne is a scarily good actor/liar turning on water works i's no bother #cbb #roxanne 
i hope so. ryan deserves for the truth to be out. it’s so upsetting for viewers i can’t even begin to think how ryan and his loved ones must be feeling! 
actually crying at @ ryanjamesthomas crying thank god they all believe the truth now and that vile roxanne has left the house so he can enjoy the rest of his time in there #cbb #karma 
grrr @ bbuk need to show that whole house the footage, feel so sorry for @ ryanjamesthomas the poor guy did absolutly nothing wrong!! roxanne is pure evil!!!! 
pls a massive apology needs to be given2 #ryan #cbbuk i’m watchin it on +1 please big brother show all the housemates the footage 
my god! i feel sick watching the lies coming out of #roxannepallett s mouth! she actually seems to believe her own lies! and the fact that the others believe her too! poor poor ryan!! this is awful!! #lies #cbb 
i really wish the housemates could see the incident! poor ryan! 
@ ryanjamesthomas i have never watched something that's made me so angry. ryan babe you don't need to justify yourself you've done nothing wrong... how dare she #madwoman 
#roxanne you horrible little bitch, trying to get the sympathy off all the boys and @ ryanjamesthomas done nothing 
why give her more air time. it won't be the truth, her people will of told her exactly what to say. x 
christ almighty you all @ penrithpanthers were almost reffed out of that game gus. as a @ sydneyroosters tragic as i am ,i remember what he did to us playing broncos .we call that sutton bloke #penaltybroncos and now #penaltystorm ! …

i will just can’t believe i didn’t win the lottery over the holidays!! #fuming!!

@ ryanjamesthomas needs to pursue a slander charge the only way to address this horror story properly. news outlets dont publish her ‘story’he has suffered enough emotional abuse from her already. go through legal channels it’s the right thing to do to stop her using this 
ed woodward - a specialist in failure @

you would have thought that a tech company such as @ curryspcworld should have the tools in place to stop this sort of thing happening. i just feel so let down that one of britain’s top stores has ruined any possible customer relation it would ever have again.

@ skysports “video not available in your territory “. so at home i pay silly money to watch sports and i am led to believe that i can watch anywhere. except on holiday. even though i have every app you publish. stupid that i can’t watch what i’ve paid for.

visited @ berkeleycastle back in june, signed a gift aid declaration and was told if we bring our tickets we can return any time within 12 months. an hour round trip today with our old tickets only to be refused entry as we didn't bring the gift aid receipt (right) 
i respect refs have a tough job to do, but refs that turn up just for the power trip are embarrassing, beaten by the better team today and we exit the cup, but with a 12th man on your side it definitely adds to the task for us. 
my first day off today... & i feel like i have been thrown into the dark ages, despite not lazing about, despite not sleeping all night long (which gave me grounds to sleep all day), despite cleaning and cooking... being met with "ffs has anything even been done today?" 
a week and a half later and my @ fabletics order still hasn’t arrived even though it’s been dispatched 
just wasted about 2 hours trying to download ios12 and it’s literally the same thing there is no difference

his face told me everything … 
they are horrendous! i holiday’ed with them 2 months ago. was promised 2 refunds for their poor service and have seen neither. just had an email response that fobs me off with a standard reply and no mention of the cheque that should have come in the post 1 month ago 
so me and another woman went to park in the same 30 minutes space. she made me move to another space. so i had to put a ticket on my car as traffic warden walking round. all i needed to do was pop in post office. she sits on her phone then when i come out she’s gone.

you mean the blue passports we could have had anyway, but the government chose not to? 
you have to laugh at debt collection agencies such as #intrimjustitia, they can take money from you but when they owe you money back you find yourself having to battle nearly 4 months to have €50 returned, now being pawned off with no one available to help my query!

i'm you've dismissed the triumphant return of zappa tbh 
give players a real chance. be sincere. if you are charging $150 (which is a two week check for some of these guys) give them a serious look. if not, charge $20 and let everyone come out and ball for fun and maybe pick one or two. #givemyboysarealshot 
not good enough @ getmein i’ve now missed out on a gig

this is not ok, i have emailed, called the darlington store and dm’d you! yet i still have not had a response or a refund! #terriblecustomerservice 
still spitting feathers at that speech. the arrogance of it. the faux innocence (“they didn’t explain why it wouldn’t work”) the victimhood. the them & us rhetoric. the disingenuity over ni. the manufactured delay suggesting she might actually have something to say. 
never ever getting an @ apple iphone again!! had them all the time i’ve had a contract but they becoming an absolute rip off!! nothing but trouble and expense!! funny how they always start breaking down once the contract ends @ samsungmobile next i think #con 
so no one in aughton will want to see the giants? or do you think we can afford to pay for a days parking in ormskirk plus more to pay on the train 
@ hermesparcels just love it when the tracking says “tried to deliver”.....well i was in and you definitely didn’t #wheresmyparcel

being called ‘love and sweetheart’ while pointing at me, strangely doesn’t endear me to people. asked him to stop calling me that and got condescendingly called ‘girl’. this was a council driver who had just hit my vehicle and didn’t stop #everydaysexism 
your fake laugh tickles me!! you know you are #peoplesvote ? you lot dont care about what the people want. angry #dictatorswho who think people are puppets and you are their master now vote again, and do it properly this time, no messing about #fullbrexitmorethanever 
i hate hate, but man my neighbor isnt on my good side. 
just wondering if visao has stopped running @ punters. late nomination for slaughter of the day from jason collett would have thought not being posted 3 wide in a 2000m race would be the instructions. oh no we won’t take a sit, let’s break the horse before the derby.... 
@ uber_support 45 minutes and my food order isn’t here!!!! can not contact as no phone number for you anywhere 
as if @ jeffreestar is in manchester and i haven’t met him! #gutted 
@ ee you should advertise that streaming bt sports doesn’t use up my data. i just spent £20 on getting an extra 10gb of data to stream the saracens game, only to find out after than it doesn’t affect it 
@ nathangrisdale you were robbed!!!! 10 times better than all them boys! #xfactor #xfactor2018 
2 if 2: ‘let’s just sit here, no one ever checks the tickets!’ tonight, there were at least three groups of people doing this in my showing alone! why should i (or anyone) pay for what many others take for free?! @ odeoncinemas @ odeonhelp

just realised i dropped £20 somewhere yesterday 
where is the passion? why do they not want to play for the club? i bet the under 21s would play with heart. bench this whole so-called first team #mufc #munnew 
none of them want to be on the field and why should we want to watch them #mufc 
embarrassing, shocking, clueless, least we know we can pass backwards #anotherwastedjourney #cheerspalace #cpfc

the refs in this league are a joke!!! no consistency whatsoever and every decision going brentford’s way #lufc 
@ easportsfifa you’re game is actually fucked for pro clubs. we won a game 8-4. we get into the next game section and back out. to fine we’ve been given a fucking loss!!! fix the mode people actually enjoy and play and stop arsing on with something that costs money 
malcontents !!!!! i would probably be banned from twitter if i actually replied with what i really want to reply with !!! #mccann 
does this look like 25g of crisps to you @ walkers_crisps ? what a rip off. 5g of crisps, care to explain where the other 20g is? 
my brother and his 2 mates got attacked in a bar on saturday night in a homophobia fuelled attack. i hope those 10 small-minded idiots feel better after attacking 3 harmless people. my brother is the least violent person out there and was just trying to protect his mate 
fuck off miami, 17-0 up and absolutely fucked it, bottled it is not the word 
i'm not paying my license fee anymore. how dare the @ bbc kill off a national treasure. 
way to go @ gwrhelp. not only is the ‘running late because of a cancelled train’ a repeated, non excuse on a sunday, but why have you employed the workd’s most sullen and unhelpful train manager??? 
bunch of lucky scouse bastards. 
i did that on uvhm tipped her like $1milli and the game glitched and didn’t give me a weapon 
@ pizzahutuk awful customer service at pizza hut dunstable white lion! take away order placed 20 min wait to then arrive and watch our pizzas under the hot plate being told to wait another 25 mins!! not happy. got home pizzas and sides cold and dried out!! £70.00!! #awful 
taking a 4 point hit for auba to laca thinking auba is too poorly. auba comes on with half an hour left does more than laca!! #fpl 
@ talktalk seriously getting fed up with the internet constantly going down today. my partner @ wackygt has been in contact with you and there has been no willingness from you guys to solve this. this is not the service we expected when signing up with you! 
@ tescomobile not happy with your courier choice #poorservice #letdown

so go to @ mcdonaldsuk order cheese bites go to eat them, they’re f**king chicken nuggets! not the one when you don’t eat meat! #veggieproblems #ifeelsick 
hi @ thomascookuk. i've have a £1800 bill on my credit card but no confirmation for what. unable to get through to anyone all morning. online chat refers me to phone number which keeps you on hold for 2hrs!!! 
@ virginmedia is gareth working on line today. been sold a dud! 
and to top it off find out ellie has been helping herself to use of my bank card for things on her stupid roblox game. that's getting deleted when she gets home 
"now, dems want to impeach kavanaugh... it's an insult to the american public," trump said monday, still fuming over the confirmation.” we want to impeach you as well trump. you are an insult to the american public.

when manchester victoria announce the next train to arrive at platform 4 will be the 17:31 train to scarborough, but some train to middlesbrough rocks up and you end up on the wrong train @ tpexpresstrains 
@ scc_help why are your phone lines so crap? i've just spent 45 minutes in a queue to ask a couple of questions about my council tax. only to be cut off. #sheffield 
don’t think working hard for a company for a year will get you anywhere. no loyalties whatsoever. 
@ clarionsupport shocked that i’ve live in my current shared ownership property since the 17th august and my customer pack hasn’t even come yet! haven’t been able to pay rent as i’m not officially living there apparently! 
wonder if @ cheshireeast are going to pay for the paint work on my car from all the stone chips from the shabby road work they're having done on my road #shitjob 
sick of chasing your company for a refund, 2 weeks and counting!!! #nocustomerservice #avoid 
i’m really not political. but what a fucking disgrace america is. 
struggling at the min. i guess as soon as you realise life aint fair the easier it is to understand shite that happens. our systems as a whole are backwards. these petitions for change and awareness dont mean shit when the wrong people are in charge of such changes. 
will it be like the "review" that was promised after 12 months of the u6 contract ...as in totally fictional? are we as profession just being gigantically gaslighted by the minister?? 
you are tonight didn't your mate adam grass this jason account and get it tracked to london somewhere? how's that work out? i live in dublin.... 
@ officialpompey that penalty miss cost me £12.685.62p. i’m fuming with joe mason. i can’t believe it. #gutted #fml @ skybet # 
i’d actually be snapping if i was on #thechase and had won money in the cash builder and some clown went for the minus offer in there’s!! if they got back they’d be getting a swift jab to the ribs walking by me to their seat 
@ mcdonaldsuk shock, the ice cream machine in chippenham is still not working, surely after it has all been redone you would have an ice cream machine that works 
agree complete disappointment and highlights the deep flaw in societies ability to use social media responsibly. cannot believe idiotic belief that kate was most popular and a winner for being a liar. #thecirclefinal 
fed up of these broke ass flies trynna get all up in my room without paying me any rent #getyourownhouse 
exactly the same for me. said delivered at 17:47 and i was sat in the house. @ dxdelivery customer services and @ seetickets absolutely useless. been pretty much interrogated and called a liar @ paulheatonsolo 
when you manage to sort a decent upgrade with a lovely member of staff at @ o2 for it to then be ruined by the rudest cust serv rep ever!!! considering deleting my new contract now @ theo2 #o2 
another year i haven’t applied for the #londonmarathon and another year i haven’t got in #unbelievable #fix 
@ londonmarathon whats the point in donating my entrance fee for the last 7 years of each time i still get rejected whilst thousands that probably don’t get a place. starting to lose faith in your system. 
don’t expect to go to work & someone reverses into your car 
the sun holiday is such a scam!!! don’t be fooled @ thesun #thesun #thesunholidays 
£7 for a 7 up!!!! no prosecco for me

@ vitality_uk why do i keep getting 0 points when i’m exercising? 
never order stuff from @ jdsports they’ve spelt something wrong on a personalised item and although it’s their fault they are saying they can’t do anything about it 
@ kfc_uki how can a kfc run out of gravy at 8pm #makesomemore 
@ ryanair you’re taking the absolute mick! trying to make us pay atleast £7 extra for the privilege of sitting even close to each other..you’ve sat us 26 rows apart?! even though there’s seats available closer to each other. #badservice 
in a hotel alfie b with no red button....

at least when @ dpd_uk give u a time slot u know it’s going to arrive on time unlike @ dhlparceluk we work too you know!!!! home in plenty of time not my fault you turned up over an hour before schedule 
theresa may wearing a green ribbon to represent mental health at #pmqs is the epitome of hypocrisy. thousands of deaths under her policies, no support for mental health issues from her government and she has the front to wear a ribbon. 
@ upshelp you have some very dishonest drivers. how can a driver just slip a note to say attempted delivery when they didn't even press the door bell? 
i cannot imagine that #jesus would have agreed with people discriminating against #samesex marriage. #cakeshop 
thanks swr more strikes and now cancelling trains due to congestion at waterloo. let's fill the platforms with more angry commuters. happy wednesday everybody

@ mcdonalds no more toffee sundaes! it was the only thing i liked! #gutted 
how does this make any sense? totally ridiculous, backward step in moving away from fossil fuels. i'm not surprised with that person as environment secretary, such a bad person for it. #fuming. electric and hybrid cars: government to cut discounts … 
@ emmerdale better see the backlash and change their minds #joetate 
tfw someone is meant to know how much ur trying to juggle and they lay the good old “how busy are you?!” on you

2nd time this week i’ve ordered something and you’ve sent me the wrong size!!! paid £3.99 for next day delivery and now i can’t take them away anyway!!!! @ missguided_help @ missguided 
i can’t believe they done it. 
what the f**k is wrong with people, removing my property that doesn’t even affect them... low lives 
i bet all the annoying police interview scenes will refer to cain too 
cain on the run again he probably doesn't have long left as it is 
#blackops4 why is the pc launch 5am bst but console can play it already? 
it would be nice to inform your drivers that they need to change their route. #unimpressed late for work 
#westmidlandstrain you cancel my train due to a driver shortage! fine but no need for your staff to be so rude. how about an apology?? 
made the mistake of watching the beginning of emmerdale, it didn't take them long to start with the mind games 
for the second time @ nextofficial some of your kitchenware has been extremely unsafe. noticed a hairline crack in this, pulled at it a little with my fingers and the whole thing snapped in half, right in my hands. “dishwasher safe”, i think not! #unsafe 
@ hotpointuk your customer service is absolutely atrocious! what's the point of having offices that close at 6 & no appointments after that or on weekends 
funny how everything benefits the people on benefits yet penalises those that go out to work! #breakfastclub @ wrexhamcbc 
these am,s who voted for should me named and held accountable! no wonder wales is the preferred dumping ground. 
when parcel force said they tried to deliver but no one was home..... 
hope the government can sleep at night there killing people and don't care 
week 3 without my migraine medicine because no one at my dr’s office, pharmacy, or insurance camp any can get their shit together.

purchasing a cellphone in 2018 is highway robbery. also, why must it be a two hour process to do so? @ bell 
as a veteran with 22 years service, i am appalled at this outcome. it#have been asked to attend a primary school to talk if the day’s importance; i’d love to attend cambridge with a few of my brothers & sisters too ... #disgusted #veteransturningingraves

@ flybe @ simoncalder 23 people. bride and groom and their family have cases lost. asked for a phone number but nothing provided to the group

@ deliveroo well and truly ruined my friday night 
has anyone else had an aul one rob a goujon on them in the neppy ? #getthestrap 
@ virginmedia gave my my mum 2 options; to keep your number move to another provider or close her virgin account. her number is connected to her business, hospital appointments, work..the list goes on. this absolutely shambolic #lostcustomer

@ dominos_uk ordered a pizza with extra cheese and this was delivered. after talking with your store manager in bradley stoke, who was no help, we didn't get a new pizza and when asked for a refund, he took the pizza back and hasn't provided us with a refund.

lol when my brother got a green badge for taking a pic of a red squirrel …

still no electricity i have ended up in a hotel and to top it off @ gardencityhomes and heritage construction who say they are working on behalf of @ wythenshawe_chg are trying to pass it off as just one of those thing no apology and no appreciation for my inconvenience. 
@ britishbakeoff so we all know who the judges want to be the winner, keeping rahul in!!?? complete nonsense, fix! 
@ virginmedia i'd love to know how you work out your 10 working days?! no refund has appeared yet! 
three absolutely awful rounds and rahul stays! absolutely shocking. #gbbo more ridiculous gurning, huffing, puffing & sulking. 
seriously?! rahul 100% should have gone home. #gbbo 
i’m writing a fucking complaint to points of view! or whatever the channel 4 equivalent is! #justiceformanon 
@ threeuk absolutely horrendous service from your team tonight. 50 minutes on hold to then have an abrupt, rude sales advisor ask me to call back to verify my account & now you’re closed 
hi @ hpnews is there a phone number for compliants? a seriuosly f@@king annoyed soon to be ex customer. #bloody 
no,no,no. ffs why? … 
some people are utter jobs worths... 
how did i not know about this 
when you get told your tickets will available to collect at 5, but its an hour later ans @ ticketmasteruk still havent printed the tickets 
she didn’t make me a roast 
why does my sky box feel the need to tell me i have no signal and then interrupt me from watching the soaps @ skyhelpteam 
only just got round to watching last night’s #gbbo if rahul goes on to win it this year i will be boycotting the show!! how the hell did he survive 3 terrible bakes?! 
surely #westlife are testing the water and will add a cardiff date ??? 
i spoke to them. who escalated me to @ applesupport. after 2 hours of wasting my time with them they disconnected our chat and cut me off i’m still left with little or no signal 
typical they give him a good storyline then he disappears 
fantastic customer service @ virginmedia not!! just had someone from your company 0800 183 6411 calling me but because english wasn't his first language he couldn't get out what he was saying & hung up on me. yes i am a customer 
chose the worst day to come back to work ! signal failure at liverpool street now moor park! #tfl you are seriously slacking!! what the hell does our money go towards!!! #absolutejoke 
never is my life have i ever received such poor service from @ verynetwork arranged a return in may.. never happened so because they left if too long they wont collect as my faulty item needs to be assessed from supplier, this process was changed due to there error 
this is the sovereignty we all voted for apparently. having the standard of our food decided by the us. … 
how can @ coopuk only give 1% of what you spend to charity? bloody cheek! with the amount of overpriced products you’d think they’d give 100% #givetocharity 
this is so not right … 
you’re telling me! i had my first app cancelled by them, then had to wait 10 weeks only for them to not show up!! #letdown 
when you’re to poorly to go to the post office so you post the letter and ‘risk’ trusting @ royalmail staff not to open it and steal the £40 you sent your friend for her birthday! stupid me! money gone! #thief #nothappy #disgraceful 
@ dpd_uk where is my parcel!!! been holding on phone for 30mins and cut off 
these bitches on my course spoiling riverdale for me, 
getting pretty angry that the government reads our tweets but never likes or retweets them. #computing4wc 
so not only did @ seetickets manage to cock up the @ takethat presale. i now have an additional £7.50 extra phone bill from trying to claim my money back! 
the service from @ northernassist this morning has been absolutely diabolical. not only am i over an hour late for work but i’m also having to get a bus which takes me double the time. 
@ yazoodrinks just had one of yr chocolate milks and it tasted like gone off yoghurt 
still fuming i picked @ vodafoneuk over @ talktalk for my broadband because they were meant to be more "reliable".. i could have had talktalk internet last friday in hindsight but due to incompatancy i'll have to wait 4 weeks instead for vodafone broadband #regrets

@ sw_railway absolutely disgusted paying £73.60 return to london from andover and had to sit on the floor both ways. left at 10am and came back at 4pm. i can’t believe you charge these prices for a dirty piece of the floor on an massively overcrowded train 
i bet they did! my kids were asking questions about things they'd seen on newsround on cbbc and we talked about this. and they just kept asking why? kids are more interested and invested in these subjects than most adults give them credit for, sadly they'll pay the price 
fucking twice in one episode!!

*serious status* @ stjohnambulance crews are volunteers. we give up our free time to provide medical care in our community so that no one suffers from a lack of first aid. we do not give up our time so you can get drunk an urinate all over the back of our ambulance 
@ channel5_tv after watching britain’s favourite biscuit tonight i strong disagree with the the order you placed them in i demand you redo your surveys as neither me or the people i know was asked. i believe this was a fix and i’m not happy #justiceforjammydodgers 
let's get @ ryanair shamed... c'mon powerful guys.. @ piersmorgan @ schofe @ hollywills @ drranj please retweet so everyone gets on board.. watching dr who makes you realise how disgusting the actions were on that flight 
when you’ve been off work for a week eating pasties, cream teas and ice-cream, but tomorrow you’re back to 5am alarms and counting calories... 
@ virginmedia is the biggest rip off ever. on three occasions now i've treated my family to a film and every single time it hasn't worked. every time i've emailed they haven't responded. happy to take my money though #stickwithsky 
that’s me off twitter for the time being. 
i absolutely love nuggets! i got upset the other day cause i dropped one on the floor 
@ railwaygreat you might want to tell people that seat reservations are off so they don’t run to find their carriage...which doesn’t exist. nice one 
if i was witness to this i would’ve gone mad at that racist old man! the passengers should’ve done better. embarrassing. everyone is so worried about themselves and their flight. nothing will change if no one will change! 
omfg!!!! @ ryanair ??????? well done the guy behind ..... i would not have been so reserved or polite rt … 
since when did the rules change about getting into the arena???? make a list of rules and put it on the god damn windows !!!! 
some people don’t know how annoying buharists sound 
you need a consistent message across all entry gates. and it needs to be consistent week in week out. you can’t change the rules each week! 
@ kcomcare internet connection slow again. same every night after midnight. service is absolutely terrible. 
ladies why the hell when you sick and we know you are a picky eater, we ask you to just come in and order your food. you get stank and say i guess i will make the decision for all of us. i did not say that i said come see what you will eat so i can order. 
nope! absolutely not!!!! we need a serious discussion about chocolate... this is not the best!!! and don’t even get me started on that new shit cadbury pocket things they started - full ripped off a cereal and called it chocolate 
the 75,000 constituents of buckingham (mp = john bercow) have been disfranchised since 2009. 
i've joined these two so i can hard carry them... what can i say, i'm amazing! #osh all night! … 
well have to say i’m disappointed in @ applesupport, had iphones for the last 6 year, my iphone 7 being the latest, it’s 20 month old and has a software problem, it’s unfixable but i can pay £345 for a new one! no damage at all, a genuine fault on the iphone #unsatisfied 
pretty selfish of bt to move the boreham wood game to the early kick off the day after my work christmas party. #lofc 
i have always taken my children for regular eye tests since they were 2 years old, my daughter who is now 24 was getting some blurred vision so had a sight test, she was found to have astigmatism and a lazy eye, how on earth did they miss that over 18 years???!!! 
top tip - if you’re expecting a @ lookiero_uk parcel from @ dpd_uk don’t waste your time logging on to their website and telling them where they can leave your parcel. you will be ignored and it will be delivered to a pick up point instead 
@ dpd_uk funny that you cannot speak to a human being or directly to the driver who must still be in waltham abbey and who@could deliver to the correct address rather than to the back@of @ poundland where i don’t live. 
@ dpd_uk unacceptable behaviour and absolutely no care in the world. i want my parcel and want it tonight. driver didn’t even attempt to deliver the parcel. i don’t live in a box behind poundland #walthamabbey 
can’t believe what i have just watched #makingamurderer2 how on earth do people think they are guilty, gunna sue them for 36million so they put him back in prison. easiest way to get out of paying that. what an absolute joke! #helpless #letthemgofree 
so we leave at 7 in the morning thinking yeah life’s brilliant we arrive 3 hours later and remember everything else except the fucking suitcase #travelling #london #manchester 
@ vodafoneuk is a joke! something they seem to pride themselves on. messed up with my business phone & broadband and now messed up with a so called “free gift” cant wait to get out of this contract with the worst network provider ever! 
please everyone go watch the story @ lastweektonight did on rehab centers in florida and what that police officer said about sending their kids around from treatment center to treatment center. where is the accountability for rehab centers and their success rate? …

i hope you point out the facts to jos! this isn’t acceptable and his managerial inadequacy won’t be tolerated much longer, we are embarrassing at best #swfc the chairman needs putting to task too #swfc 
@ swfc right, enough is enough. sack him chairman or suffer the consequences. utterly clueless and no more excuses jos, your out of your depth.

5 layers of valspar on a prepped wall and it peels off?! how on earth can you justify the price or even selling it in the first place @ bandq @ valsparpaintuk #ripoff 
@ mdm_en absolutely shocking customer service. sending my sofabed with a parcel service that cannot deliver weekends or evenings. nor can they give me a approximate time frame of when the item can be delivered. do not use these people #takemymoneyandrun #donotorderfromhere 
just means ill have to save my $4.99 to sub, when you make affliated sad times, but you'll smash it.... #oosh 
3/3 then i get a text on 23rd october saying that call this number to pay to continue using service. i call the number and explain they keep putting me on hold and then drop the call #wastedtime #poorcustomerservice #complaint 
thanks m40 you absolute arsehole ! #carpark #traffic #engineoff

@ cineworld your elbows! 
@ asdaserviceteam slipped and fell tonight in your carlisle london rd store with my little girl. the floor was covered in water! reported it to a 'colleague' and customer services who advised it had already been reported just not dealt with. badly hurt my shoulder! 
last week was a sick joke. i am still not over the fact that ruby won star baker without doing the technical part of the technical. 
absolutely done with @ askebay we have been treated horrifically, lost money and been de-frauded, missed planned days out because of it and you still don’t help and leave us more stuck! and let the fraudulent people get away with it! never again will i use ebay! #scammed 
@ bbuk it's unfair that cameron may win supposedly for coming out on tv that he is gay his family knew and used it to gain viewers votes i now wonder if you knew too 
i dare someone to piss me off today 
how i'm feeling right now thanks @ adventure001 @ virginexp worst policies + customer service i have ever experienced #virginexperiencedays #watchdog @ bbcwatchdog 
@ skyhelpteam recorded a film on sony movies using sky q, but it only recorded half of it. this has happened for the 2nd time. why is this? #nothappy 
@ westlifemusic yet another date added in belfast that makes 3!! but not one in wales, which is part of the uk. makes no sense #disappointed #heartbroken seen every concert so far and now not going to see #westlifetwenty 
seriously @ amazonuk? i get bought a present, super rare occurrence, and it goes missing! marked as delivered, definately not. get some better delivery drivers! #deliverywankers #annoyed 
never ever use @ homeaway @ homeawaypr we booked through this company now once we’re back from the holiday we are being accused of damage that we have never done and now homeaway don’t want to help us fight this! and we can’t get our deposit back. 
@ northernassist you need to get your act together, when there’s one train every hour to certain places, at least make sure you have a plan b when a service is cancelled, not happy! the @ conservatives need to shoulder the blame too: privatisation. doesn’t. work!!!! #late 
@ nottscc so this is blocking the path and blocking to cross the road. i just had to walk into beechdale road with 2 kids and a pushchair. n9 signs put saying walk this way. so so dangerous and not safe. the workers saw me and didn't even help is cross the road! 
@ michaelkors when you send your bag off to mk bcos its faulty they can't replace it due to stock but say they can only refund your bag if i return to a mk shop! you already have the bag! #beengoingonformonths 
they seem to have missed me off the ‘cat pyjama-jam’ invite list. bbc news: us embassy in australia apologises for cookie monster cat email … 
how much simpler would life be if your car actually moved 
when you won sod all on the bingo #bingo 
thanks @ nextofficial for taking my money for 2 sofas 7 weeks ago, delivering one, lying that the other had “defects” and then stating a 14 week replacement time to fix the defective sofa. 6 months (circa) is a long time to make and deliver a sofa #crapcustomerservice 
so not only do @ dorothy_perkins lie on their dispatch emails, which state you have 10 working days to pick up an order when they mean 10 actual days, they also ignore direct messages and can’t seem to take a customer complaint seriously 
@ nationaltyres is it commin practise to advise a customer they need a whole new exhaust system when they don’t !!! nearly paid £400 but after a professional second opinion it ended up a back box at £79 !!! #upsellingdisgrace 
travelled to banbury for a toby carvery ... @ tobycarvery to find the restraunt closed!! i had booked a table but no call or email to say they had to close ? so i travelled from oxford with a hungry 1 year old for nothing 
how can @ hermesparcels make 2 separate attempts to deliver my item but failed twice as no one was available when have been sat in my office all day!!! disgrace of a company!!! updated my status to say delivered at 2.33pm changed it at 3.21 to unable to delivery.

i'm with you! and am 
@ isleofislay is that what you want to known for ??? promoting shooting? that’s disgusting, poor goat , minding its own business and then a murderer shoots and being allowed by u!!! how can it b fair gun v poor goat grazing hope u rot in hell all of you … 
@ asklyft @ lyft why why why is your map app taking me through route with more traffic. this is ridiculous. my driver just took me ten minutes off course and now we’re sitting in traffic on the cross bronx expressway. this road doesn’t even go to my destination!!! 
@ scssofas didn’t expect to pay another £130 for an upholsterer to take my sofa upstairs as delivery drivers couldn’t do it ! fuming is an understatement. no sofa to sit on for a week either 
@ southamptoncc if i had pipped out 3 kids from 3 different fathers, at least i know i would of got a house and a nice life from you.

how to ruin someone’s day: park your mobile speed camera near someone’s work around 9am.

@ littlemix bought cd to get pre sale and couldn’t get tickets sold out in 10 mins! yet others got them in general sale today! how is that fair!

fantastic performance from every forest player! great point and we can be proud......but the ref has robbed us!!! some of the officials are a joke in the championship. 2pts could be vital at the end of the season and that was an obvious handball #nffc #coyr 
daylight robbery. linesman needs to hang his head in shame. #nffc #lufc #handball

what a joke @ asdaserviceteam click and collect again waiting ages then they bring the wrong order out!!! #thisisajoke #couldntbeslower 
omg. you know why i have trust issues? because every time i trust someone, they let me down. 
@ poundland this is false advertising. 
literally fuming with @ amazon. ‘delivery before 9pm’ is like saying ‘you’ll die anytime between now and the day you die’. my package was meant to be here yesterday. i need it in an hour and i’m no longer home having waited in as long as i could. 
oh hold up, @ jdsports have just dispersed us for the second time now queuing for @ nelsonagholor - we've been waiting in the store for an hour and a half. learn how to do your job guys. 
@ bet365 i think you need to check your website!! i placed a premier league 5 fold, just went to check on it and some how there's a 6th bet on my slip for rayo someone or other!! #wtf 
this is what greeted me when i came out of @ wickeserith this morning. broad daylight in the middle of the car park. thankfully they didn’t get in the van...but nor can i now, back doors won’t open... 
@ iamlewisdean omg you had it in the bag , you were well and truly robbed #gutted 
rockstar realllllyyyyyy gone did the dirty on me & killed off one of my favourite characters already didn't they % done #rdr2 
disgraceful we don’t get to see/hear what lewis said that was so bad. take our money, want our support but don’t air a vital event. #disappointed #feelletdown #cbb 
sick to the stomach seeing people well not people scumbags mocking the hellicopter crash. they are nothing but lowlifes who does this , i don't care who you support or if leicester city are your rivals. it's disgusting to read through tweets of scumbags making jokes. 
seeing as you have removed practically the only deserving winner....i have no idea, thanks for that!! @ iamlewisdean you should have won it! … 
so now @ comcast can't get a tech here till 7:30 tomorrow and expects me to stay here when tech missed the 1st appt. fuck that. i was here all day!! i gotta look into dish. why do we only have 2 choices?

when you spend loads on a shit night out

oh patricia. you are the worst kind of person taking minus 13k on the chase?! #thechase #itvthechase #unforgivable 
if anyone wants to take me out for tea as @ sainsburys delivery still hasn’t turned up, now 5 hours late, (but still taken my money from my bank account) that would be appreciated thanks!!! 
astounded that i received punches to my stomach from a boy whilst shopping today!! no apology from his parents just screamed in my face that he is autistic... fully understand that however that was out of order! only thankful it wasn't a pregnant lady! 
certain people do make my blood boil #fuckingbrilliant 
@ o2 i’m in the usa have o2 travel paying £4.99 per day and i can’t send pictures via imessage or what’s app.. 
@ gwrhelp horrendous train journey! the 11am from plymouth to london paddington. not enough seats! elderly people and women with children sitting on the floor! now we’re terminating at reading 
@ legolandwindsor a god awful day, how can u expect a 4 year old to queue for 2 hours especially when the sign said 60 mins? also we paid our parking to find out everyone else left for free as the barriers were up! 
i just found out that around 500,000 people are detained each year for illegally crossing the southern border... and fucking trump is making a big stink about a "caravan" of 7000 people?? the gop is shamelessly distorting this so called "threat"! #caravan #caravancon 
very naive comment from @ chris_sutton73 and lazy journalism. disrespectful to non league football, the dying breath of the beautiful game. 
#bbuk need to state exactly what lewis said as everyone is imagining something horrific and it’s not fair, goes against basic fundamentals of the social experiment that bbuk started out as 
. @ bastilledan when is new music coming?? and no, “soon” is not an acceptable answer 
people seem to be and must let you know it everytime they make an announcement 
@ bastilledan when is new music coming?? and no, “soon” is not an acceptable answer 
‘little extras’ is such an incredibly insulting and condescending term to use . ‘bung teachers a couple of extra glue sticks, that ought to shut them up’ … 
@ mcdonalds hankridge taunton yesterday outdid there incompetence levels by some distance. not only getting our brekie order wrong but also every portion of food turned up colder than a penguins backside. absolutely useless! 
i had to share it didn’t i! 
@ dailymailuk will you printing a full front page apology to the srivaddhanaprabha family, leicester city supporters and people of decency after your vile headline? if any leicester fan ever touches your rag again they don’t deserve to be associated with the club 
@ altontowers.i appreciate h&s is a priority but at various points over the last 2 days 1 or more rides have been out of action.should you be conning the public out of entrance fees if the conditions arn’t going to be ideal to run the rides 
anyone else's place of work make you work 3 weeks in hand? and then a further 5 to then receive a full months pay?! ..didn't think so that combined with hours cut to 12 a week someone's gonna get a fucking punch in the face.. i don't do getting mugged off, ever 
another hour wasted #aplaceinthesun 
always get excited getting post but not when it’s a fucking parking charge 
that seems like an awfully long time. 
shocking service @ debenhams in beverley yesterday. bought a pair of shoes, wore them once on 6th sept to find yest all the leather had cracked right across 1 shoe. asked for another pair to be effectively called a liar and humiliated in front of the que behind #disgrace

@paulhollywood & @ prueleith absolutely made the wrong decision! @ kimjoyskitchen should have won that hands down!! rahul should have been out weeks ago! this is the shit that happens on channel 4 #gbbofinal 
literally me right now . … 
this delay has forced me to eat cake. 
what a fix! rahul has had a shit few weeks and a shocking final and has still won! #gbbofinal 
#gbbofinal @ channel4 @paulhollywood absolute fix, thanks for ruining bake off for a 2nd year running. he should have gone 2 weeks ago at least. 
no!! bollocks. absolute favouritism from week one. total waste of 10 weeks. might as well have just given rahul the cake tray in the 1st week kim-joy, ruby or briony deserved it so much more. just because he's a wet blanket doesn't mean he deserves to win #gbbofinal 
pissed off with @ channel4gbbo winner 3 years in a row #raging

@ topshophelp i placed a order with yourself & used a £30 gift card. i returned some of this. so i’m thinking as i still spent over that the £30 gift voucher would come off the items that i kept, simple. but no you choose what it comes off so i’m now stuck with a gift card 
individuals getting stitched up in prison is a real issue. it exists. some prison officers think they have the right to decide wheather they should make someone’s like unbearable or just keep their head above water. they think that can play god. #prison

you ever had one of those days where the usual casual racism from your colleagues goes up a notch and you realise that trying to make them see sense won’t cut it so the only answer is to call them out for being the racist c**nts that they are!! 
@ glasses_direct ordered a pair of glasses from you after poor services from @ visionexpress only to get a email from you, offering the same glasses at 50% off before mine even arrive. #poorservice

@ veryhelpers can you believe its been almost a year ive been fighting you for this crazy just hope @ financialombuds will kick you up the backside!! … 
i’m in it for that cat tbh yet it doesn’t speak 
appalling customer service just now by antony @ tesco express tabard square. refusing to honour the price advertised for an item i was trying to purchase. i shouldn't be penalised if you and your staff are not doing your job correctly 
@ jamesvillasuk just got back from florida, appalled with the cleanliness of the villa we stayed in! had to clean virtually everything on arrival after a 9 hr flight. not a good start to our holiday

@ dominos_uk just waited over an hour for my pizza and when it arrives it’s freezing cold wouldn’t be a problem but in a hotel with no microwave #notgoodenough 
@ dpd_uk you really have tested my patience today. an incompetent driver attempts delivery to a wrong address (thank god you take pictures of doors), was promised twice that it would be delivered this evening for it to go to the depot and won’t allow me to collect. 
what a night...if only they hadn't made that triple substitution when vale were winning berbotov lennon and defoe...didn't get back to vale park until 5am either fooking road works #sva #vtid

yet again let down by @ greateranglia . arrived 30 mins late yesterday for an important meeting and then miss my personal engagement due to a cancelled return train 
remind me again how dangerous the caravan is compared to these bigoted, embittered white males here at home? #icant 
i swear @ threeuksupport have the worst customer service department. over 30 hours since i spoke to someone about my lack of internet, and 5 advisers later i’ve been told it will be activated within the next hour. i was told that 5 hours ago too. 
i don't understand why they didn't release that date originally & add another date as an extra date. i think it's because they know they will sell a 4th date because it's opening night so people will want tickets. i'm not spending any more on them. ive already spent £800 
the lads might not have any control on what date the added date is on but it's all about money for the tour promotors. the tickets are way over-priced. i don't like moaning but this tour is taking the piss. take us back to the old days #fuming. it's taking away the excitement 
cheers @ santanderukhelp , our banks incompetence has led to us losing our help to but isa bonus due to staff not understanding procedures 
@ hm u guys need extra servers i’ve had 2 items taken from my basket! & now it won’t let me check out what’s left it keeps saying an error as occurred this simply is not on!

@ realdonaldtrump in orange county #florida they sent me a mail in ballot which i returned by mail early, but today when i called to check on it i was told by oc commissioners office they have no record of even sending me a ballot. … 
so when a 51 is approaching and you walk up passed the 52 blocking the stop to stick your arm out. then the 52 pulls away and 51 drives straight down bus lane even though you and someone else are flagging it down. tell your drivers to open their eyes @ firstsouthyorks

#nothappy someone, when building our @ persimmonhomes house, stuck a nail for the skirting board straight through a water pipe. didn’t want a water feature in our bedroom!!

imagine buying yourself a bottle of wine, to be walking up the path to your front door. literally two steps, the bag breaks and the bottle smashes. the ants are on the echo falls and not me 
today with @ wicks in haverfordwest- this banner was hanging off the wall and smacked me in the eye when the wind caught it - spoke to their desk about it - no apology almost blamed me for walking into it - #poorcustomerservice 
i've only gone and left my fucking house keys at work.

sorry @ shanofficially has just been the victim of an absolutely travesty! those girls should not have been saved from a song off 3 times this series.... they’re too young for the industry & will probably have 1 song & disappear #xfactor 
nah, i hate x-factor. i’ve absolutely just lost my complete nut at shan going home. why be a judge if you can’t make a decision on who can go home? deadlock is a cop out! 
@ thexfactor #joke 
sorry x factor rotten to the core! 
#xfactor what a piss take absolute joke how about change the rules simon so that the girls go !!! not shan 
@ simoncowell proper needs to sort xfactor out i've never seen so much shit in my life when best singer in competition gets sent home against 2 bags of shite who scream down microphone #fixfactor 
fuming at @ thexfactor!! #wrong 
vidler and metcalfe topped off their miserable weekends by missing the sides first two penalties and we were as good as out. perry ensure he dived the wrong way for each durley kick and the dream of a treble was over. fair play to durley who showed zero quality throughout 
absolute joke, i am lost for words/there are no words, i keep repeating myself, yet again but this 2 great acts have left the #xfactor once again, still have shit acts remaining & isn't it ironic that louis has still all of his acts, simply a big con and big fix!! 
couldn’t watch this weeks @ brooksyhfc demanded we put xfactor on got it on the planner though. 
aw these are taking the piss now! kidnapping the chicks! #dynasty #dynasties
