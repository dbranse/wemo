#women are more sensitive to in order to get them to clean things, like #children, houses, spaces, etc. to get them to do the #chores. sexual disgust, i dunno, selectiveness + that already proneness to disgust, probably.

yes, just look at the research e.g. of @ sentientist on the effect of on sexual arousal in women and then look at the self-report surveys about how much women enjoyed giving #oral sex and you will know that such surveys on sex are useless when it comes to women/politeness

that is factually incorrect. the bill specifically bans a wall, and contains funds for a fence, and only with the same tech we already used. 
but it's a publicity stunt. fully recyclable and comparable cups already exist. if @ starbucks were truly committed they would introduce these alternatives now. but hang on, that would impact profits. #starbuckstrash #plasticpollution 
3) and due to lower #disgust-reaction, really a man is more likely e.g. to kiss his wife's #clitoris or something than the other way around. however, lesbians report too much disgust even with #cunnilingus. 
6) so anyone saying #pain is the definition of bad #sex is confused or lying. as soon as you are aroused even pretty bad pain does not matter. the problem is not being #aroused - and that is evidently more affected by #disgust. 
4) i'll tell you myself from a male perspective that #pain is really not that significant an interference to pleasure, and is much more significant, even for a man. 
2) ... and discomfort than most parts of a man's body, but also the main source of his pleasure. there is however only if anything pain, not disgust. reduces #pleasure, not pain. 
and by signing that omnibus bill trump just proved that he is not a conservative. liberals have to be ecstatic at all the rinos in this pathetic government. #disappointed #omnibusbill

@ ricksantorum, i do not care *more* about an illegal immigrant murdering a girl in iowa. i care about all of the issues on the same level, including a potus who is a serial liar and shamelessly uses this poor murdered girl and her grieving family to distract.

you're everything that's wrong with government today #disgust#trumpsucks 
trump doesn't want anyone to ever forget, not for 1 day, how horrible a person he really is; how bereft of any sense of humanness he possesses. he wants people to love & admire him but as he's done all his life, he does the very things that cause the opposite reactions. 
you have a nerve criticising theresa may, especially over apartheid, when @ uklabour is currently known as the racist party, and is singling out the jewish community for the most disgusting abuse since the actual nazis. is this supposed to be irony. #disgust.

@ brinks_home new home owners were willing to take over security monitoring contract but because of your disgusting service they wont. what's worse is we cant even pay 485 dollars to your mickey mouse club to cancel because each #r@$ keeps transferring the call. 6x times.

oh yeah, benedict donald is at it again. 
i cannot believe what i am reading this morning - "rain"? you are as dishonourable, as you are a coward. in addition, one does not "celebrate" - one "commemorates" and that ww1 was one of the bloodiest & costliest conflicts is neither in doubt, nor is it a competition. 
capitalism is when you tap on a photo to like on instagram but it shows you the prices of the items instead 
don't you know who died today? you are running the video clip of ananth kumar hegde, folks! have some respect for the dead and some information about the living! ignorant, illiterate channels, too lazy to suit and fact check news.

@ amazon as a 12-year customer, i have to voice my with the process of setting up as an amazon seller. i went through this process, followed every step to a 't'. i was rejected for failure to verify id, though passport, driver's license both sent- #frustrated beyond words.

@ realdonaldtrump do you ever get tired of running this great country into the ground. you're a very terrible, narcissistic, uneducated moron. you've tarnished the image of this country at home and abroad. you've alienated our allies and copied up with dictators. 
#snipes should be ashamed to use racism as a cover for her bias & status preservation. 
i ditched a suitcase in reykjavík 5 months ago. i wish i could abandon another one now. blah. so. much. stuff. #packing i will wear all of my clothes on the plane. i can't believe i"m flying again. 
the disgustingly #corrupt & self-serving, self-enriching behavior of the trump gop. & i will likewise turn away in from any democratic candidate who stinks of that kind of political ambition & #cultureofcorruption ... 
what is wrong with these people?! look at the detail and you'll see that there are still people celebrating the acts of those who took up arms against their country to defend the enslavement of human beings. 
talking to @ bianchikristin about exposures that elicit #disgust. that’s what we do. talk about football and #cbtworks #abct2018 @

bloody hell. in the bus with 6 china tourists and they are loud as hell, and one guy keeps spitting out the window. it is embarrassing when you look like them but are not them! #divainmyanmar 
#bbcbias … 
exactly. the premise that whatever economic investment that comes from sa is worth lives, or our collective morality, is a fool's choice and has been. we don't rise & fall based on a thug's investment. trump's family's fortunes, however are tied to dictators. 
school fails to report their student being raped/hazed with broom handles...time to shut those doors for good. … 
metra.. and bnsf.. looking right at you. you could open those train stations during the cold and dark from 1 am to 5 am and leave me and my brothers and sisters the hell alone! but you won't do that.. because you want it to be pretty in the morning for the commuters. 
you have some of the most expressive facial expressions i have ever seen! #whyme!?! 
i hope someone helps this family by taking this case to the highest court. a ruling needs to be set for all insurers. they get away with this on a daily basis. it's as bad as corruption. the agent has already earned a lot of commission out of this policy as well.
